        text: 'The Cherry Audio CA 2600 is a powerful, self-contained duophonic synthesizer inspired by the classic ARP 2600. Every aspect of the original, from the quirky oscillator waves to the powerful ladder filter was modeled with tremendous precision. And although it features very similar functionality, we''ve added numerous updates to increase its flexibility and usefulness. Most notably, we''ve added distortion, delay, and reverb effects - instead of being "tacked-on" like most softsynth effects, these are fully integrated into the user interface with CV control of almost every parameter - we think you''ll enjoy them!

        text: 'CA 2600 features semi-normalled audio and modulation paths for modular synth-style flexibility, but like the original ARP 2600, the normalled connections allow rapid sound creation without the use of patch cables. Incidentally, CA 2600 uses the same highly refined and super-fast and patching system as its big brother, Voltage Modular, making routing, moving, and multing cables a pleasure. '

We think you''ll find CA 2600 to be the best 2600 emulation ever created, and hope you enjoy scaring the neighbor''s dog with it as much as we have! '
