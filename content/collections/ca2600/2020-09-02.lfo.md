        text: "A low frequency oscillator or \"LFO,\" is similar to an audio oscillator, but it typically runs at frequencies below the range of human hearing, and it isn't used an audio source. Instead, its cycling waveforms are used as a control source to add modulation to oscillators, filters, and amplifiers.\_"

        text: 'A typical application would be to slightly modulate an oscillator’s frequency to create vibrato (pitch modulation), or to modulate a VCA’s amplitude to create a tremolo effect (amplitude modulation). Modulating the cutoff frequency of a filter can create a dubstep-style wobble, or if modulated very slowly, long sweeping tonal shifts.'

        text: 'Unlike the original ARP 2600, we''ve added an "extra" low frequency oscillator (LFO) - on the original, it was necessary to use one of the voltage controlled oscillators for modulation. The extra LFO leaves all three oscillators available for audio (or extended mod purposes).'

This simplifies setting up CA-2600 for vibrato, pulse-width mod, or filter wah wah with a mod wheel - turn the switch on, patch a cable from the LFO Out to one or multiple oscillator FM mod jacks, and push up the corresponding FM slider.'

By default, the delay is triggered by the keyboard gate (i.e. playing MIDI notes), but can be overridden by plugging a cable into the adjacent jack (try this with a slow clock, for example). The delay range is 0 to 3000 ms. '
