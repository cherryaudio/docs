        text: 'The Voltage Processors section is perhaps the most misunderstood section of the original ARP 2600, but it''s actually easy to use, and very useful. It essentially consists of three invertible signal attenuators (the first one with an integrated VCA), a lag generator (aka, glide), and a  1/2 step voltage quantizer. As with other 2600 inputs, the input jacks include normalled signal paths for ease of use. '

The level can be CV controlled if a cable is patched to the '
