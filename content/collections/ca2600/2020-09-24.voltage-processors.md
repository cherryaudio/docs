        text: 'The Voltage Processors section is perhaps the most misunderstood section of the original ARP 2600, but it''s actually easy to use, and very useful. It essentially consists of three invertible signal attenuators and a lag generator (aka, glide). It''s easy to miss, but CA 2600 also adds a  1/2 step voltage quantizer at the very bottom. As with other 2600 inputs, the input jacks include normalled signal paths for extra utility. '

        text: '- This is a signal attenuator. If you''re not familiar with attenuators, it''s just a fancy word for "amount" control. If an audio signal is fed through it, it acts as a volume control; if a control signal is fed through it, it acts as an amount control. If the slider is set fully left, it''s at zero; sliding to the right increases the amount. '

        text: '- Signals fed through the quantizer voltage processor will be "rounded off" to the nearest 1/12V step, i.e., the nearest half-step. This is useful for transforming constantly changing (rawp, saw, triangle, or sine waves) or randomly stepped (sample & hold) waves into musically useful melodies. Note that quantizing occurs after the attenuator slider, so adjusting it alters the amount of signal going to the quantizer, which effectively changes the pitch range. '
