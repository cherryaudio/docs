        text: '- Obviously you won''t be able to plug real cables into the front-panel jack (unless you know something we don''t), so the default routing is to receive signals from a DAW sidechain signal path. The specifics of sidechain routing vary dependent on DAW software, but once the signal is routed to CA2600, the three-LED meter in the corner will display signal level. You''ll ideally want the first two green LED''s to illuminate, and avoid the top red LED. '
