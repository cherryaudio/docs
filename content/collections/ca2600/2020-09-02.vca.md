        text: "You can think of the Voltage Controlled Amplifier (VCA) as a \"gate\" to start, stop, and shape the volume of audio or control signals. Applying a simple gate voltage will abruptly open and close the VCA; the CV output of an envelope generator allows shaping of audio and control signals with more finesse.\_"
