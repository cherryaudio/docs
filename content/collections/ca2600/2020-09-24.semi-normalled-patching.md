        text: 'If you''ve worked with patch bays in recording studios, you may be familiar with the concept of semi-normalled connections. This means that certain connections are invisibly patched by default if no cable is plugged into a jack, but plugging a cable into the jack interrupts the "normalled" signal flow and replaces it with the patched cable. The adjacent orange boxes indicate the default signal source if nothing is plugged into the the jack. '

And even if you''re an experienced modular user, the numerous normalled connections make sound creation super fast and fun. '
