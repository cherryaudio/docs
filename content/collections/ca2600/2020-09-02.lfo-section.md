Because DCO-106 includes separate LFO’s for each polyphonic voice, onset delay is independent for each note, which is a nice effect when playing melodies or arpeggiated note passages. The LED above the slider gradually illuminates to visually indicate the fade; the LFO  is at full intensity when the LED is fully illuminated. '
