        text: 'CA2600 includes two independent envelope generators; one is a standard ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release), and the other is an AR (attack, release) with some unique features. These are generally used to shape VCA amplitude contours and VCF cutoff frequency, but can be used to control numerous other CA2600 parameters. '

        text: 'When CA2600 sees a gate voltage from a note, the envelope generator outputs a dynamically changing voltage, according to the settings of its four stages. The attack stage defines how long it takes for the output voltage to rise from 0 to 5 volts. Once the attack stage reaches 5V, it moves to the decay phase, which defines how long it takes to fall from 5V to the setting of the Sustain phase. Unlike the attack, decay, and release phases, which define times, sustain simply sets the held voltage level following the attack and decay phases - this equates to the envelope output level while holding down a key. Finally, the release slider defines the the length of time it takes for the voltage to fall back to 0V when the gate input voltage is removed, i.e. when the key is released.'
