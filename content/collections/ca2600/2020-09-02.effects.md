        text: 'CA2600''s effect implementation is somewhat unique in the sense that, instead of being "tacked on" and hidden behind menus, they''re integrated into the main interface, and have CV inputs for almost all of their controls. Applying CV''s to the effects parameters can range from subtle (reverb mix) to total insanity (delay time mod with high feedback settings). '

This arrangement is useful, because it allows a great deal of flexibility if, for example, you''d like totally wet reverb signals (incidentally, "all-wet" reverb signals aren''t possible with the original ARP 2600 master mixer).
