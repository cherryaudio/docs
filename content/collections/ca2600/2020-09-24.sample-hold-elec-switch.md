        text: "The sample and hold section repeatedly “samples” a varying input signal voltage, and outputs the \"snapshot\"  voltage (i.e. a constant voltage) until it is triggered to sample again.\_Note that when we say \"sample,\" we're referring to a simple incoming voltage - this isn't an audio sampler that you can sample and playback beats with. (Though this is the basic principle of how digital audio samplers operate)."
