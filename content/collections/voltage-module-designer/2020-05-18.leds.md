        text: 'This sets the LED “brightness” (actually a state image), with a valid range from 0 to 1. If it’s a simple on/off LED skin, it’ll be in the ‘off’ state if the value is less than 0.4 and in the ‘on’ state otherwise. If the LED skin has more than two states, the state to display will be the number of states multiplied by the LED value and then rounded off to an integer, which will be used as a zero-based index into the array of state images. Here’s a screenshot of a module showing the “Red” LED skin, which only has on and off states, and the “Blue and Red” skin, which has off, red, and blue states, with each skin at various values from 0 to 1:'
