          the correct module type helps Voltage mix audio in the most efficient manner.

          Voltage modules are sized according the the Eurorack specification. Eurorack modules are all
          128.5 millimeters high, or approximately 5” high. The width of a module is measured in units
          called Horizontal Pitch, or HP. One HP is .2” wide. Voltage module sizes are always in integer
          units of HP. The Width dropdown will allow you to select the width in inches, and it will also
          show you the size in HP and in pixels.

          The module shown is 3.2 inches wide, which is 16 HP. At 100% zoom, the module will be 230
          pixels wide by 360 pixels high. You can use these dimensions to create custom background art
          for your module.

          This is the visible name of the control. It is important to name every control well, because these
          names are often visible to the user. For example, a volume control should be given a
          descriptive name, such as “Master Volume”. ​Note that every control name must be unique.
          In addition, once you have published your module, you should not change the control
          names, as they are used to save & restore the settings of a module.​​ So please take care to
          name every control well from the start.

          Every control is represented by a variable in the Java code. To make programming easier, it is
          recommended that you give controls a descriptive variable name. For example, a volume
          control might be given a variable name of volumeKnob. A variable will be automatically created
          for each control. It will look like this:

          Every control will have automatically-generated code that creates the control, sets its position,
          and sets any flags and properties. When you change any property of a control, including its
          variable name, all of the automatically generated code will be instantly updated to match the
          new settings.
