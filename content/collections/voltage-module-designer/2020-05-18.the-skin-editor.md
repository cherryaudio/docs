The skin editor will copy any source image files it needs to the save folder, so you don’t need to keep copies of them in their original locations in order for the skin to keep working."

This control will also work on knob and slider skins, though you can just click on the knobs and sliders themselves, and will even work on button and switch skins in the unlikely event you want to use a slider to turn them on and off. For other kinds of control skins, it’ll have no meaningful effect (technically, you can use it to count from 0 to 1 on a digital counter).'
