        text: 'The image control displays a still image on your module. If you’re displaying a raster-based image (JPG, PNG, etc.), we recommend you use an image with double the dimensions of your display size so that it won’t look pixelated at higher zoom levels - so if you want an image to display at width of 100 and height of 150, for instance, use a 200 x 300 image as the source. The API will likely change to allow you to provide separate low and high-resolution images at some point.'
