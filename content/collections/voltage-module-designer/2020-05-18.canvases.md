        text: 'A canvas is a control that, in its default form, doesn’t do anything at all. It’s up to you to paint it and handle any mouse interactions that occur. Use a canvas when you want to draw something (a graph or waveform, for instance), create a custom control, or just generally do something that the module designer’s native controls aren’t capable of. Voltage Modular’s Oscilloscope module, to cite one example, uses a canvas control to draw a graph of the input signal.'
