        text: "“Button” controls are conventional push buttons that depress when you click on them and return to their unpressed states when you stop clicking on them. If you want a button that stays down after you stop clicking (and possibly one that’s part of a set of radio buttons), use the “Toggle Button” control instead. While toggle buttons are great for showing state, regular buttons are \_better options if you want to start an action - play or stop buttons, for instance."
