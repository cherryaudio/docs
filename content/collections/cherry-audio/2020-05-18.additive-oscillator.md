        text: 'The Additive Oscillator lets users combine the first eight partials in the harmonic series to create composite tones with a choice of sine, triangle, or variable-width pulse waves. Inspired by 70’s “West Coast” synthesizer modules, it includes separate outputs for each partial, and allows the partial levels to be modulated in a number of creative and intuitive ways. First we’ll explain the function of each control, then we’ll explore the Additive Oscillator in use.'
