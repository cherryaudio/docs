        text: 'Though it bears a resemblance to a classic 80s sampling keyboard, Sampler II works a little differently. It can hold one sample at a time, and can play back one note at a time. And because it has no onboard amplifiers or envelope generators, it''s best to think of it more as a sophisticated digital oscillator (as opposed to a self-contained sampling instrument). Since samples don''t necessarily play continuously as a standard oscillator would, we''ve included a few different trigger modes to accommodate different ways you might to use it.'

Not only did the sliders make real-time sample editing super easy, its niftiest trick was that samples could instantly be played in reverse by swapping the start and end points. Sampler II lets you do the same- if the end point is set before the start point, the sample will play backwards. As mentioned, when Loop Enable is on, the loop always plays from the loop point to the end point. If the loop point position is modulated using its CV in, it's possible to move the loop point past the end point. Not only does this allow changing from a forward loop to a backward one, it makes very nifty noise as you cross over the end point. To try this, patch the I/O panel Mod Wheel out to the Loop CV mod input (you may need to experiment with positive or negative mod amount settings depending on the loop point location)."
