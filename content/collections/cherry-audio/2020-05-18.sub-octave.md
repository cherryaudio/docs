        text: 'The Cherry Audio Sub Octave module is a sub-octave generator that tracks the pitch of an input signal and generates square waves one and two octaves below it. There are individual attenuators for each sub-octave as well as the direct input allowing you to create the perfect mix between the three signals. This module will instantly fatten up an oscillator and is a quick way to add some weight to your sounds!'

        text: 'Although this module is usually used to create lower octaves of oscillators or audio signals, it is worth noting that it will also work on LFOs and can create some interesting patterns when mixing the two sub-octave square waves with the original.'
