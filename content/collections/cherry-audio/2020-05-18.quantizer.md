        text: 'The Cherry Audio Quantizer module is designed to conform a control voltage input signal to a specific key and scale, or a user-defined set of notes. There are 29 preset scales available and custom scales can easily be created by manually toggling individual notes on or off using the virtual "keyboard." Pitches are tracked and quantized according to the standard 1V/octave scaling.'
