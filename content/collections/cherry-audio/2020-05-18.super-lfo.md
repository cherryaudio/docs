        text: 'We named it "super" for a reason! The Cherry Audio Super LFO (low-frequency oscillator) module is jam-packed with killer features. It can be used as a standard cycling LFO or switched to "one-shot" mode for use as an envelope generator. It includes a built-in sync divider and reset input for easily syncing the LFO to a host DAW, or can be used in free-run mode with CV-controllable rate. But the real showstopper is its mindblowing custom waveshaping flexibility... with seven waveshaping parameters, a huge real-time display, and bipolar CV control for real-time manipulation, the possibilities are endless. The final word in LFO modulation!'
