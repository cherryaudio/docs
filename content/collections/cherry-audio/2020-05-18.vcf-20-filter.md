        text: 'The Cherry Audio VCF-20 Filter is an analog-style, voltage-controllable, dual highpass/lowpass filter that recreates the aggressive tones of a classic 70s Japanese monosynth. Its uniquely raunchy sound totally transforms the overall tonality of Voltage Modular! The two resonant filters can be used individually, in series, or manually patched in various configurations and are both capable of screaming self-oscillation. We carefully A/B''d the VCF-20 Filter with the coveted "version 35" filter of the original instrument and we think you''ll be delighted with its authenticity.'

This is a quick way to use both filters in series with only one input patched. Note though that this bypasses the input stage level control of the lowpass filter. It is possible however to manually patch the filter in series and use both input stages.'

        text: '- Emphasizes sound energy at and around the cutoff frequency by adding feedback from the filter’s output back to its input. As the peak is increased, any modulations or knob twisting of the cutoff frequency becomes more pronounced and can create the classic “vowel-sound” this filter is known for. When turned up past seven or so, the filter begins to feed back enough to self-oscillate. (Note that unlike the original, a cable must be patched to the filter’s input to hear it self-oscillate. This is designed to save CPU when the filter is not in use.)'

        text: " You may notice that VCF-20 doesn't necessarily distort in the expected way when using the standard green Voltage Modular Oscillator (especially with square waves). This is because the wacky, characteristic MS-style filter distortion is partially the result of the not-exactly-correct-on-an-oscilloscope waveforms output from the original MS synth oscillators. These \"incorrect\" waveshapes are accurately recreated in the VCO-20 Dual Oscillator module, so try it in conjunction with VCF-20.\_"
