                  whatever the # of pulses setting is. In this mode, pulse #1 is
                  always on (hence always green); you only need to click the top button to select the # of pulse counts (how long it rests after the
                  pulse on 1). When it reaches the last selected pulse #, it
                  advances to the next step.
