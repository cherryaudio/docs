        text: 'This module can be used to replicate a number of acoustic sounds such as snare flams, hi-hat rolls and guitar strumming but is just as comfortable creating a cacophony of bleeps and bloops from another world! Try running a clock signal or LFO through the Micro Burst and use its output as the external trigger source for a Sample and Hold module. Modulating a resonant filter’s cutoff or an oscillator’s frequency can create some pretty crazy results!'
