Consisting of two \"peak\" (bandpass) and one lowpass filter with multiple routing configurations, its excels at creating unique vocal-like timbres and includes extensive CV capabilities. This lets you easily create funky \"talking\" synth sounds. Lyrinx is super easy to use and capable of a wide array of timbres."
