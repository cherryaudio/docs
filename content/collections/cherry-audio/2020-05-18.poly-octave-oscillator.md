        text: 'The Cherry Audio Poly Octave Oscillator is a polyphonic oscillator with four mixable octaves per voice. The MIDI input receives pitch and note on/off messages and internally routes them to the oscillator’s frequency and internal amplitude envelope respectively. This module is the perfect starting point for an organ or lush pad! Waveform options are saw, sine and a voltage-controllable variable-width pulse wave.'
