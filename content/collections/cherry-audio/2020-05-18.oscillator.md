        text: 'The Cherry Audio "standard" oscillator is a full-featured classic analog-synthesis oscillator. It generates all standard synthesis waveforms and can be used as an audio source, or as a control voltage (CV) modulation source. Its waveform outputs are always “on”; you’ll need to use a mixer or amplifier (VCA) of some sort to start and stop its sound.'

Its default setting of 50% outputs a perfect square wave, rich in delicious odd-order harmonics. Moving the knob left or right narrows its width as well as the thickness of sound until it almost disappears at its extremes, and we’ve included a nifty “faux-OLED” display to indicate the current pulse width.'
