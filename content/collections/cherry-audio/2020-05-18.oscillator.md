        text: 'The Cherry Audio "standard" oscillator is a full-featured classic analog-synthesis oscillator. It generates all standard synthesis waveforms and can be used as an audio source, or as a control voltage (CV) modulation source. Its waveform outputs are always “on”; you’ll need to use a mixer or amplifier (VCA) of some sort to start and stop its sound.'

The advantage of linear mod is that it stays constant regardless of the base frequency, which makes it useful for audio-range modulation (i.e. mod frequencies 20 Hz and faster) when the mod source is to alter tone color. In use, you''ll find that expo mod allows notes and scales to play in tune, whereas expo mod in the audio range allow neat ring mod-style sound effects, but doesn''t usually allow properly pitched half-step scales.'
