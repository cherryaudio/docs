        text: "VCO-20 accurately replicates the tone and functionality of a classic 70s Japanese monosynth, including all waveforms and a white noise source. It also adds CV-controllable pulse width on VCO 1, and hard sync inputs for both oscillators. Because of its unique waveforms (i.e. not-exactly correct), it's the perfect companion for the VCF-20 Filter module.\_"
