        text: 'The Six-Input Mixer module is a six-input, mono-out mixer for audio or CV signals featuring solos and mutes on each channel. Mixing audio signals is something most of you are probably familiar with but don’t forget that this is a CV mixer as well. LFOs, envelopes, pitch CVs, even clock and gate signals can all be mixed together to create unique and interesting control signals.'
