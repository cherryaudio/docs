        text: "AirVector is a quad envelope for audio sources that\_dynamically mixes up to four input sources. The volume of all four sources is controlled in four quadrants by a virtual joystick, and joystick movements can be programmed with a flexible and easy-to-use vector envelope. It's inspired by the vector synthesis concepts used in the classic Prophet VS, Korg Wavestation, and Yamaha SY22/TG33 synthesizers.\_"

        text: "It's closely related to the Cherry Audio AirWave vector oscillator module, but unlike AirWave, it contains no onboard sound generation. Its primary intention is to dynamically mix audio waves to create composite sounds, but it can be used with any audio source material, from simple waves to entire songs. With four individual outputs, it can even be used for quad-surround audio mixing.\_"
