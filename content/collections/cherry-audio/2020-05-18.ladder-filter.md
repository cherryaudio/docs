        text: 'The Cherry Audio Ladder Filter is a CV-controllable, 24dB/oct, low-pass filter based off the famous transistor ladder filter patented by Bob Moog in 1966, and made famous in the Moog Modular and Minimoog synthesizers in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to the classic Cutoff and Resonance (or "Emphasis") controls, we’ve added a Saturation knob as well for overdriving the tone even further! This filter is the definition of raw, raunchy, and powerful!'
