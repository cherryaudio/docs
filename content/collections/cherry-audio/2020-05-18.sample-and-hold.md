        text: 'White noise is often used as an input source to generate a random stepped-CV signal. Modulating the pitch of an oscillator with this will create the classic sample and hold sound often heard in sci-fi movies. Play with the rate and amount of modulation to create all sorts of bleepy-bloopy goodness! “What was that R2-D2?”'
