        text: "AirStep is a digital oscillator that allows sampled waveforms to play in stepped, sequential patterns of up to 64 steps in length. Step durations can be controlled via internal or external clock source, and as you might expect, AirStep features a number of CV mod inputs as well as dual trigger outs, allowing external augmentation of patterns.\_"
