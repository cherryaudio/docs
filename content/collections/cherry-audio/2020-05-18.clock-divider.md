        text: 'The Clock Divider is a dual module that slows incoming clock pulses by a factor of two to sixteen. The modules can run independently from one another or be linked so that the clock input and reset jacks from the first module are shared by both.'

        text: 'Let’s look at a sixteenth-note clock signal as an example. Dividing by a factor of two means that one pulse is output for every two pulses received resulting in an eighth note clock signal. Dividing by a factor of three means that one pulse is output for every three received which is the equivalent of dotted-eighth notes. Dividing by a factor of seven doesn’t result in a common note duration, but the same principle is used. The divider only outputs one pulse for every seven pulses which by the way can create some really cool poly-rhythms!'
