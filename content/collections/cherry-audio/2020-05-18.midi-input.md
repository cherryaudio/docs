        text: "The Cherry Audio MIDI Input module receives MIDI messages sent from an external MIDI device and converts them to CV signals for use within Voltage Modular. Using this module in addition to the CV Outs section of the I/O panel makes it possible to route MIDI data from multiple external MIDI devices to different parts of a patch. An external sequencer could be used to play notes in one part of your patch while a midi keyboard controller is simultaneously used to play a different part of the patch.\_"
