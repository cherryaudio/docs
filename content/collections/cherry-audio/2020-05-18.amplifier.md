The most common control signal would be an envelope generator (for shaping the amplitude curve of notes), but any control signal can be patched here, including gates, LFO''s, sequencers, noise generators, sample and holds, etc.\ The voltage level applied corresponds to the input signal''s amplitude, with 0V = no signal passed and 5V = full amplitude passed.'
