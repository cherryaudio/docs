        text: "The Cherry Audio Limiter module is an extreme \"brickwall\" style limiter for audio signals. Limiters can be used subtly to \"catch\" the loudest peaks of a signal to keep it from clipping or quite aggressively to \"smash\" a signal’s dynamics. They are famously known for their use in the mastering process to increase the overall level of a song while also making it sound punchier and \"larger than life.\"\_"

On many limiters, this knob is referred to as \"Gain\" or \"Input Gain.\" Turning the knob up increases the level of the input signal being sent to the limiter’s level detector. The louder the signal is, the more \"Reduction\" is needed to keep the signal from exceeding 0dB.\_"
