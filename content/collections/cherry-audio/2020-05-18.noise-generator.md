        text: 'Noise signals are random-voltage signals that can be used as audio or control signals. As an audio signal, noise is often used to emulate the percussive hit of a drum or the breathiness of a voice. As a control signal, it can be a great source for creating randomness in a patch. Noise signals are often used as the input signal of a Sample and Hold module which can adjust the rate at which random voltages are output.'
