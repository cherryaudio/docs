        text: '- Adjusts the amount of time it takes for the CV output to decrease in voltage as the input signal’s amplitude decreases. When tracking percussive audio signals this will be very similar to a traditional envelope’s release stage. However when tracking less dynamic input sources, the release time acts more as a smoothing value for the CV output.'
