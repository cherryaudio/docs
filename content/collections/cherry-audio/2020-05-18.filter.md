The advantage of linear mod is that it stays constant regardless of the base frequency, which makes it useful for audio-range modulation (i.e. mod frequencies 20 Hz and faster) when the mod source is to alter tone color. (As opposed to adding vibrato/wah-wah/tremelo, etc.) In use, you''ll find that expo mod allows notes and scales to play in tune, whereas expo mod in the audio range allow neat ring mod-style sound effects, but doesn''t usually allow properly pitched half-step scales.'
