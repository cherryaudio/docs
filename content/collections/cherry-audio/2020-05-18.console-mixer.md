        text: 'The Cherry Audio Console Mixer module is a powerhouse 12-input audio mixer featuring two effects sends with stereo returns and a three-band EQ (with semi-parametric mids), solo, and mute on each channel. This is the perfect “mission command” module for any live performance setting as well as a great utility for getting all of your sounds to gel just right.'
