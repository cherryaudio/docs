        text: 'The Binary module is a dual module that continuously tests an incoming audio or control signal to determine if its voltage is greater than zero (> 0) or less than zero (< 0) and outputs a selected voltage whenever the condition is true. The output will always be a binary signal, meaning it is either on (outputting the selected voltage) or off. It basically creates a series of gate signals which can be used to turn things on and off, trigger envelopes, step through sequencers etc.'

        text: 'One of the coolest things about modular synthesis and Voltage Modular is the ability to create unique relationships between modules so that they “react” to one another. The Binary module can “automatically” trigger an event or action based on other signals already present within a patch. It could be used, for example, to send only higher notes of an arpeggiator to a reverb send or change a drum sequencer’s pattern every time an LFO passes zero.'
