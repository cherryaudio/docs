        text: 'The MIDI Clock Divider allows Voltage Modular to be synced to external devices such as drum machines, synths, and sequencers which are capable of sending MIDI clock. This module divides a 24-pulse-per-quarter-note MIDI clock signal into slower, musically relevant note-values, and outputs a voltage-based clock signal that can be used to advance sequencers, switches, etc. inside of Voltage Modular. Clock divisions can be set from 1/32-notes to 4 bars including triplet and dotted values.'

        text: '- A 5V pulse received at this jack will immediately reset the clock divider. Note that most devices that send MIDI clock also send "Start" messages when the external deviceâ€™s Play button is pressed which will automatically reset the MIDI Clock Divider. Remember to reset any sequencers, switches, etc. that are being triggered by the clock divider as well so that everything starts at the same time.'
