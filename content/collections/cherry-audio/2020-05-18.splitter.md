        text: 'The Splitter module is a MIDI utility module for easily creating “split patches” where the upper and lower portions of a MIDI keyboard-controller send pitch, gate, and velocity MIDI and/or CVs to separate destinations. This can be used, for example, to play a bass sound with the lower keys while playing a lead sound with the upper keys. The split point can be set at any MIDI note and multiple instances of the module can be used to split the keyboard into any number of "zones."'
