        text: "When two signals are multiplied by one another, the resulting signal contains only the sum and difference of the two signals and not the original signals themselves. This often results in tones with unrelated harmonics which can sound harsh or out of tune, but when dialed in carefully can create sounds and timbres hard to create with other methods.\_"
