        text: 'The Cherry Audio One To Eight Switch module routes an audio or control input signal to eight individual output jacks. Signal is only passed from an output when its respective “step” is active. The outputs can be stepped through sequentially with a manual or CV trigger, or targeted individually via discrete control voltages.'

        text: 'Switches are used to re-route signals without having to unplug or re-patch any cables. As an example, the One To Eight Switch could be used to pass a clean audio signal from one output while sending another output to a distortion module and another to a delay unit. The fun starts when you begin experimenting with different ways to step through the outputs!'
