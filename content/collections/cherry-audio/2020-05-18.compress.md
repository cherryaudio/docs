        text: 'The Cherry Audio Compress module is a simple compressor effect with gain and reduction metering for controlling and/or shaping the dynamics of an audio signal. Compressors come in many styles and are used for various applications. This module has static attack and release times that are good for general dynamic control and/or creating punchier percussive sounds.'

        text: 'For anyone unfamiliar, compressors lower the output level of a signal once its input level passes a threshold. This helps reduce the dynamic range of an audio signal. This module uses a simple approach to compression with only two controls. First set the amount of compression using the '
