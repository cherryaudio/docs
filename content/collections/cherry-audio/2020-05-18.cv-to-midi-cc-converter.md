        text: "- selects which MIDI CC (continuous controller) number the CV signals will be converted to. MIDI CCs are used to control parameters on hardware equipment. A synthesizer, for example, may have a filter cutoff knob which can be externally controlled via MIDI CC# 102. Any CV signal from within Voltage Modular, be it an LFO, envelope, or sequence, can be converted to MIDI CC# 102 and used to control the synth’s filter cutoff frequency. Refer to your hardware’s user manual or MIDI implementation chart to determine which CC#s control its parameters.\_"
