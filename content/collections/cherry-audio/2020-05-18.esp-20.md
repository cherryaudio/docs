        text: "The Cherry Audio ESP-20 Processor recreates the slightly bizarre and endlessly useful External Signal Processor section of the classic MS-20 synthesizer. ESP-20 analyzes incoming audio and generates matching voltages for controlling oscillator pitch and envelope amplitude, letting you \"play\" Voltage Modular by singing, playing guitar, or any other monophonic signal source. ESP-20's frequency converter has a much wider range than the original for increased functionality, while still retaining the inherent quirkiness.\_"
