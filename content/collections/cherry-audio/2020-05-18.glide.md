        text: 'The Glide module is used to slide smoothly from one input control voltage to another. This is typically used to slide between pitch CVs creating portamento as one note glides to the next. The module features an adjustable speed, linear or constant curve, and a CV jack for enabling and disabling the glide in real time.'
