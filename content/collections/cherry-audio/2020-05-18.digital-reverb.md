A room that is full of people and/or has soft walls, for example, will soak up high frequencies quicker than an empty room with cement walls. Turning this knob to the left allows the high frequencies to last longer simulating brighter rooms, while turning the knob to the right will dampen the high frequencies more quickly to simulate a darker room.'
