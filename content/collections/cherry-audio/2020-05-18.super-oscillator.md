        text: 'The Cherry Audio Super Oscillator is our mondo-powerhouse, pull-out-all-the-stops oscillator module. It''s capable of creating an endless variety of waves, many of which you wouldn''t expect from a traditional analog-style oscillator. It''s surprisingly easy to use, and all of its fabulous waveshaping parameters are voltage controllable. On top of all that, it features a large, real-time animated waveform display for visual representation of the current waveform (plus it looks really neat).'

Interestingly, triangle, square, and all points in-between create a wave rich in odd-order harmonics (real-world examples include clarinets and Wurlitzer electric pianos).'

It will affect the sound more noticeably when the Shape knob is set to create the aforementioned "vertical line" in the center of a wave. As you''ll see, experimentation is key.'

Wavefolding''s effect is look to see if the wave goes above (or below) a specific threshold. When it does, instead of clipping off the top and bottom of the wave, they create a mirror image of it and reflect that portion of the wave back upon itself, creating more high harmonics and interesting spectra in the process.'

They are often adjustable to allow several folds to occur on a single positive or negative excursion beyond the folding threshold, which causes increasingly bright and noisy sounds on the output.'

Moving the knob left or right narrows its width as well as the thickness of sound until it almost disappears at its extremes, and we’ve included a nifty “faux-OLED” display to indicate the current pulse width.'
