        text: "Besides being a stupendously good name for a comic-book villain, Hex Phaser takes the standard phaser effect and adds features out the proverbial wazoo. Though it vaguely resembles a classic 70s phaser effect, its unique feature set allows endless colors and tonal variations. These include individually switchable stages and feedback insert point, as well as extensive modulation, taking it waaay beyond the standard \"two-knob special\" stomp box.\_"

        text: 'In order to get the most from phaser, let''s talk a bit about how phaser effects work. Phasers make use of a special type of filter called an "all-pass" filter. Unlike low-, high-, or band-pass filters, an all-pass filters allows all frequencies to pass through. So what good is that? Though it passes all frequencies, it alters the phase relationship of part of the audio spectrum. By itself, you wouldn''t hear any audible difference, but when the signal is inverted and combined with the dry signal, phase cancellation occurs in regions of the audio spectrum. Varying the center frequency of the all-pass filter (i.e. where the phase cancellation occurs) results in the familiar swooshing sound we know as "phasing."'

        type: text
        text: "If a single all-pass filter is used, the effect is rather subtle. Engineers found that stacking multiple all-pass filter stages created a deeper, more pronounced swooshing effect. This is why phaser effects are sometimes referred to as four-stage, six-stage, etc. (Most of the classic stomp box phaser effects use four stages.) Another way phasing effects are intensified is by feeding back an inverted version of the phased part of the signal (i.e. not the unaffected dry signal) back into one of the stages.\_"

This is particularly useful if you'd like to use a tempo-synced LFO or a stepped sequencer.\_"
