        text: "Synth Voice is a powerful, self-contained monophonic synthesizer. It's inspired by the classic ARP 2600 synthesizer, and like the 2600, features \"semi-normalled\" audio and modulation paths that enable fast and often wild sound creation. It includes two oscillators, a multimode filter, ADSR and AR envelope generators, a low-frequency oscillator, sample and hold, ring modulation, and a simulated spring reverb. Because it's part of Voltage Modular, any and all of its individual sections can be combined with other modules for maximum creativity.\_"

This means that certain connections are invisibly patched by default if no cable is plugged into a jack, but plugging a cable into the jack interrupts the "normal" signal flow and replaces it with the patched cable. The orange boxes along the bottom of the Synth Voice panel indicate what the source is if nothing is plugged into the the jack above. In other words, '

Set to lowpass mode, a 12db per/octave filter has a shallower slope, whereas a 24db per/octave filter has a steeper slope (as well as more pronounced character with the resonance knob turned up).'

The triangle wave is bipolar (i.e. its voltage sweeps above and below 0 volts); this works well for pitch modulation because the pitch rises and falls above and below the center frequency. The square wave is unipolar, that is, it only goes up then returns to zero; this makes it easy to set up pitch trills or octaves. (Setting up a bipolar square wave for alternating octave pitch modulation is difficult because the high note gets higher and low note gets lower as mod depth is increased.)'
