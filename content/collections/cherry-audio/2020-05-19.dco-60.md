In addition, it’s loaded with patch points and mod inputs that immensely expand its flexibility and allow individual sections to be freely combined with other Voltage modules.\_"

Looking at the DCO-106 panel, you’ll notice that its sections have the appearance of multiple modules, with inputs at the top and outputs at the bottom. If these sections were standard Voltage modules, you’d need to patch each of them together appropriately to hear sound. (i.e. oscillator output to filter input, filter input to amplifier, etc.) In the DCO-106 module, all of these sections use normalled connections “under the hood,” making it function like a conventional hard-wired standalone synthesizer. But as described above, normalled connections can be overridden by simply plugging cables into the jacks.\_"

        text: "For example, to add a second poly oscillator, you would patch a cable from the IO Panel Poly Pitch out to a Poly Oscillator, then patch its output to DCO-106’s HPF or VCF input. Because plugging into a normalled jack overrides the existing normalled connection (in this case the DCO output), a cable needs to be patched from one of the DCO outputs to the filter input, as shown in the image above. For finer control of oscillator balance, the external oscillator and DCO-106 oscillator could be routed through a poly mixer module prior to the filter input.\_"

If the switch is in the Off position, the LFO is always “on.” Its effect is immediately audible by moving the LFO sliders in the DCO and VCF sections. Moving the switch to the On position activates a normalled connection from the IO Panel CV Sources Mod Wheel jack, and enables control of LFO depth with an external keyboard controller mod wheel. If the mod wheel is all the way down, LFO depth is zero. This makes setting up a mod wheel to add vibrato or wah effects very easy.\_"

Because DCO-60 includes separate LFO’s for each polyphonic voice, onset delay is independent for each note, which is a nice effect when playing melodies or arpeggiated note passages. The delay time can be CV controlled with the CV jack and attenuator beneath the slider. LFO Delay time can be CV controlled with the CV jack and attenuator beneath the slider. The bipolar attenuator knob’s center position is zero; turning it to the right adds positive mod, and turning it to left adds negative mod.\_"

        text: '- Short for “resonance,” this emphasizes sound energy at and around the current cutoff frequency by adding feedback from the filter''s output back to its input. At lower settings, this can be used to create mild resonances such as those heard in acoustic instruments. DCO-60’s implementation is fully self-oscillating - at extreme settings, it can be used as a sine wave generator, but be careful because high resonance settings can result in loud, screamy, dog-terrifying (and speaker blowing) occurrences. The CV jack and attenuator beneath the slider enable voltage control of its amount.'

        text: 'When a gate voltage is sent either from the normalled IO Panel Poly Gate jack or from another source into the Gate In jack, the envelope generator outputs a dynamically changing voltage, according to the settings of its four stages. The Attack stage defines how long it takes for the output voltage to rise from 0 to 5 volts. Once the attack stage reaches 5V, it moves to the Decay phase, which defines how long it takes to fall from 5V to the setting of the Sustain phase. Unlike the Attack, Decay, and Release phases, which define times, Sustain simply sets the held voltage level following the Attack and Decay phases - this usually equates to the envelope output level while holding down a key on a keyboard controller. Finally, the Release knob defines the the length of time it takes for the voltage to fall back to 0V when the gate input voltage is removed, i.e. when the key is released (hence the clever name).'
