Besides looking cool (who doesnâ€™t love looking at waveforms in realtime!), this is an extremely helpful tool for learning about modular synthesis or troubleshooting a complicated patch.\_"

Having a consistent trigger point for where the voltages are displayed on the oscilloscope creates a stable waveform when monitoring cyclical signals such as oscillators. Try patching a sine-wave oscillator to the input and switching between - , +, and neither to see the difference.'
