        text: "The Cherry Audio Oscilloscope is a handy utility module featuring two inputs, range, zoom, and a freeze button for monitoring audio and CV signals. Besides looking cool (who doesnâ€™t love looking at waveforms?), this is an extremely helpful tool for learning about modular synthesis or troubleshooting complex patches.\_"

Try patching a sine-wave oscillator to the input and switching between - , +, and neither to see the difference.'
