This is most useful when using short delay times and can sometimes result in a more "hollow" or flanger-like sound when mixed with the original non-inverted signal. Note that this jack inverts the mix of both the dry and wet signals. If both outputs of this module are combined, they will completely cancel each other out resulting in silence! Therefore, it is usually a good idea to use the delay as a parallel effect or aux send with the '
