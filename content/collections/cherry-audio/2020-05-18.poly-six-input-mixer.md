        text: 'The Poly Six-Input Mixer module is a six-channel mixer for polyphonic CV or audio signals. Each poly input jack accepts up to 16 "lanes" of audio or CVs which are mixed to a single poly output jack. This can be used, for example, to mix the audio outputs of Poly Oscillators or to combine multiple polyphonic CV signals sent from Poly Envelope Generators, Mono to Poly CV modules etc.'
