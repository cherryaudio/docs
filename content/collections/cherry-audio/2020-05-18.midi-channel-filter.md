        text: 'The MIDI Channel Filter module allows easy selective filtering of any combination of channelized MIDI data and includes "All On" and "All Off" buttons to quickly enable or disable all MIDI channels. This module can be used in various ways including muting/unmuting MIDI channels on the fly, splitting data to multiple MIDI destinations, or rerouting MIDI channels. You could, for example, use the MIDI Channel Filter to isolate a single channel of MIDI from a signal and reroute its data to a different channel and/or destination using a MIDI Output module.'
