The \"resonators,\" aka, filters are globally switchable to operate in highpass, bandpass, or lowpass modes, and they're fantastic at imparting an organic feel to otherwise blah patches. If you've ever heard \"The Model\" by Kraftwerk, almost every sound in the track makes use of the Polymoog's resonators section.\_"

        text: 'By most accounts, the original Polymoog version has two major shortcomings: the filter slopes are a little too shallow to create really dramatic resonance effects, and the filter cutoff frequencies aren''t CV controllable. We''ve addressed both of these issues with a 12/24 db slope selector, as well as bipolar CV inputs for each filter''s cutoff frequency (which allow killer phaser-ish swept sounds). Best of all, Vintage Resonator costs a fraction of the original, and we excluded the endearing Polymoogs-are-ALWAYS-broken "feature."'

        text: 'In the original instrument, Moog got a little fanciful with their use of the word "resonators." In actuality it consists of three state-variable filters in a parallel configuration. In other words the signal doesn''t flow into each filter, one after the other - the signal is split, runs into all three filters and their collective outputs are mixed together. This means that settings on each section won''t interact with settings on another, resulting in three separate filter tonalities sounding simultaneously (dependent on '
