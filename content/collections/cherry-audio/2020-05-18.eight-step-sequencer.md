        text: 'If you''re not familiar with using step sequencers, the step sequencer concept is the forerunner of modern MIDI DAW software; the basic idea is that each step outputs a pitch and gate CV, making it act as a sort of "player piano" for melodies or CV control signals. Eight steps (i.e. notes) may not seem like much, but step sequencers can be used for a variety of applications and are highly useful for pattern-based music and modulation.'
