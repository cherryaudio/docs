Its default setting of 50% outputs a perfect square wave, rich in delicious odd-order harmonics. Moving the knob left or right narrows its width as well as the thickness of sound until it almost disappears at its extremes, and weâ€™ve included a nifty "faux-OLED" display to indicate the current pulse width. All oscillators in the stack are controlled simultaneously by this knob.'
