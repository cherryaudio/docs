        text: 'The Cherry Audio Arpeggiator is a classic "vintage-style" arpeggiator. In case you''re wondering, an arpeggiator is basically a step sequencer that takes a chord as its input, and plays each note of the chord individually in an ascending or descending pattern over one or more octaves.'
