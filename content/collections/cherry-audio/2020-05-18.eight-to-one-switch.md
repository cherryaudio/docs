        text: 'The Cherry Audio Eight To One Switch module routes eight audio or control input signals to a single output jack. An input signal is only passed to the output when its respective “step” is active. The inputs can be stepped through sequentially with a manual or CV trigger, or targeted individually via discrete control voltages.'

        text: 'Switches are used to re-route signals without having to unplug or re-patch any cables. As an example, the Eight To One Switch could be used to send different modulation sources to a single destination or switch between different oscillator waveforms. The fun starts when you begin experimenting with different ways to step through the inputs!'
