  description: 'The Super Envelope Generator is a full-featured DAHDSR envelope (Delay-Attack-Hold-Decay-Sustain-Release). The shapes of the attack, decay, and release stages are individually controllable, morphing from exponential to linear to logarithmic, and these shapes can all be modulated via control voltage. On top of that, the length of each stage and the sustain level is CV-controllable as well!\_'
