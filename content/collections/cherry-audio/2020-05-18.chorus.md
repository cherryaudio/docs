        text: 'The Cherry Audio Chorus module is a great sounding and flexible stereo chorus effect featuring CV control of delay time, feedback level, and wet/dry mix. Chorus is created by mixing an audio signal with one or more slightly delayed and pitch-modulated “copies” of itself and is often used to make a sound seem bigger, richer, and wider.'
