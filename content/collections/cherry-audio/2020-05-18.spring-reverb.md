        text: 'The Cherry Audio Spring Reverb module is a realistically modeled spring-style reverb with adjustable decay length and true-stereo operation. Spring reverbs can be used in many situations. Short decaying spring reverbs are great for adding a little energy or life into a sound without drastically changing it, while long decaying spring reverbs can take a sound into an entirely new dimension! And let''s not forget how cool a classic surf guitar riff sounds drenched in spring reverb!'
