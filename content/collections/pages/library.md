    text: '<h3>Modules Tab</h3><p>The library <em>Modules</em> tab displays all modules currently owned by the logged-in user (that’s you, bub). This is where you''ll go to add new modules to patch, either by clicking <em>Add</em>, or by dragging-and-dropping to a cabinet.</p><p>For more information about the <em>Modules</em> library tab, see <strong><a href="/voltage-modular-user-guide/working-with-modules" target="_blank">Working With Modules</a></strong>.</p><h3>Cabinets Tab</h3><p>A “cabinet” refers to a single horizontal row of modules. In contrast to presets, which save and load <em>all</em> modules and cabinets as a single entity, saving and loading cabinets allows mixing and matching of rows of modules, aka cabinets. This allows subsections of larger presets to be moved freely between patches. Cabinets also offer a time-saving way to load and save templates for sound creation. When the <em>Cabinets</em> tab is selected, all saved cabinets are displayed in the library column.</p><p>For more information about the <em>Cabinets</em> library tab, see <strong><a href="/voltage-modular-user-guide/working-with-cabinets">Working With Cabinets</a></strong>.</p><h3>MIDI Tab</h3><p>This tab displays information about how hardware slider/knob, button, and pad MIDI controllers are assigned to on-screen controls. It''s also where you can see and configure DAW automation and Performance Controls Panel assignments.</p><p>For more information about the <em>MIDI</em>&nbsp;library tab, see <strong><a href="/voltage-modular-user-guide/MIDI-continuous-controller-setup">MIDI Continuous Controller Assignment</a></strong>.</p><h3>Store Tab</h3><p>The <em>Store</em> library tab lets you purchase modules and sounds from directly within Voltage Modular. Purchased modules and sounds are automatically downloaded and installed for use in Voltage Modular. For information about using the <em>Store</em> library tab, see <a href="https://store.cherryaudio.com" target="_blank"><strong>The Voltage Modular Store</strong></a>.</p>'
