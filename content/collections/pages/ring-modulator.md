    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Ring Modulator multiplies two input signals together, typically resulting in a metallic tone with inharmonic overtones often used to recreate pitched percussion instruments such as bells and chimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When two signals are multiplied by one another, the resulting signal contains only the sum and difference of the two signals and not the original signals themselves. This often results in tones with unrelated harmonics which can sound harsh or out of tune, but when dialed in carefully can create sounds and timbres hard to create with other methods.&nbsp;</p><p>Itâ€™s worth mentioning that any two signals can be multiplied by the Ring Modulator. Try multiplying two LFOs to create a more complex LFO shape or multiplying a drum beat and a synth lead!&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Inputs, Outputs and Controls</strong></h2><p><strong>X and Y Input Level</strong>- Attenuators for reducing the level of the input signals. Changing the level of the input signals can help "dial in" the tone or timbre of the output.</p><p><strong>X and Y Audio In jacks</strong>- Input jacks for the signals that will be multiplied. Although labeled as audio inputs, CVs can also be multiplied to create more complex control signals and audio signals can even be multiplied by CVs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>X and Y CV Mod jacks</strong>- CV inputs for externally controlling the level of their respective input signals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Out jack</strong>- Outputs the result of multiplying the X and Y input signals.&nbsp;</p>'
