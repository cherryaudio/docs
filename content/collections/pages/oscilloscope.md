    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Oscilloscope is a handy utility module and slick visual component featuring range, zoom, and a freeze button for monitoring audio and CV signals. Besides looking cool (who doesnâ€™t love looking at waveforms in realtime!), this is an extremely helpful tool for learning about modular synthesis or troubleshooting a complicated patch.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</strong></h2><p><strong>Input jack</strong>- Patch CV and audio signals here to visually monitor their voltage.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Auto Trig</strong>- These buttons are used to "stabalize" the visualization of the signal. When neither of these buttons are engaged, the voltage received is displayed without a consistent trigger or "starting point" within the display window which can sometimes appear jumpy and unstable. By engaging the <em>-</em> button, the oscilloscope will always show voltage starting from 0V at the left hand side and decreasing, while the + button will show voltage increasing from 0V. Having a consistent trigger point for where the voltages are displayed on the oscilloscope creates a stable waveform when monitoring cyclical signals such as oscillators. Try patching a sine-wave oscillator to the input and switching between - , +, and neither to see the difference.</p><p><strong>Freeze</strong>- Instantly freezes the display. The signal that was present at the moment the button was clicked will be displayed until the button is turned off again.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Display window</strong>- A classic analog-style oscilloscope display showing the signal received at the <em>Input</em> jack. The horizontal line in the center represents 0V. Positive voltage is displayed above the 0V line while negative voltage is displayed below.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Range</strong>- Adjusts the range of voltage shown within the display. Think of this as a vertical zoom.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Zoom</strong>- Adjusts the sample length of the display window. Think of this as a horizontal zoom.<strong><br></strong></p>'
