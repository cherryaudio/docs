    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Poly Multiple is a dual module that "copies" the CV or audio signals received at its "poly" input to four poly output jacks so the signals can be sent to multiple destinations. When the&nbsp;<em>Link</em>&nbsp;button is engaged, the input from module one is sent to the outputs of module two as well, creating a total of eight copies. Since every jack in Voltage Modular can have up to six cables connected to it, itâ€™s possible to send a mix of six polyphonic input signals to as many as 48 poly outputs when linked!&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Inputs, Outputs and Controls</strong></h2><p><strong>Input jack</strong>- This is the input jack for the poly CV or audio signal that will be copied to the output jacks. As many as six poly cables can be patched to this input.</p><p><strong>Output jacks</strong>- These four jacks output a copy of the poly signal received at the input jack. Each jack can have up to six cables patched to it for a total of 24 possible copies.</p><p><strong>Link</strong>- When this button is engaged, the input from module one will be copied to the outputs of module two as well, and the input of module two will be ignored. When linked there is a total of 48 possible copies.</p>'
