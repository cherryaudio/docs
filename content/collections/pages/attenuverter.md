    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Attenuverter features three independent modules for attenuating and/or inverting audio or control signals. Attenuators are used to reduce the level of signals while inverters “flip” the polarity of a signal making positive voltage negative and negative voltage positive. While that doesn’t sound like too much fun, it is an extremely useful and invaluable tool within any modular system.<br></p><p>Signals within Voltage Modular start out as full-amplitude signals that often need to be turned down. An LFO, for example, can be used to create vibrato by subtly modulating an oscillator’s frequency. But if the LFO signal is not attenuated first, the result will sound more like a sci-fi laser than vibrato!</p><p>The Attenuverter also comes in handy when you have multiple CVs patched to a single input. Reducing their levels individually before the CV input is an effective way to "dial in" the perfect amount of modulation from each signal. The CV or mod amount knob on the module can then be used as a master modulation amount that attenuates all of the CVs at once while keeping their relative levels in tact.</p><h2>Inputs, Outputs and Controls</h2><p><strong>-∞ to Unity</strong>- This knob scales the amplitude of the incoming audio or control signal from 0% to 100%.</p><p><strong>In jack</strong>- Input jack for the signal that will be attenuated and/or inverted.</p><p><strong>Inv (invert)</strong>&nbsp;- Engaging this button will invert the polarity of the signal. All positive voltages from the input signal will be negative in the output signal and all negative voltages will be positive. Be careful not to mix a signal and its inverted signal together at the same amplitude or they will completely cancel each other out!</p><p><strong>Out jack</strong>- Output jack for the attenuated and/or inverted signal.</p>'
