    text: '<p>The Six-Input Stereo Mixer module is a six-channel mixer for audio or CV signals featuring stereo inputs, pan controls, solos and mutes on each channel. This is typically used as a straight-forward stereo mixer for audio signals but don’t forget that it can be used as a CV mixer as well. If you think of the <em>Left</em> and <em>Right</em> output jacks as outputs “One” and “Two,” the module can then be used as a routing device to mix CV signals in various ways between the two outputs.</p><h2><strong>Inputs, Outputs and Controls</strong></h2><h3><strong>Input Channels 1 - 6</strong></h3><p><strong>L(M) and R Input jacks</strong>- Stereo audio or dual CV input jacks. Use the <em>L(Mono)</em> jack to send mono signals to both outputs.</p><p><strong>Level</strong>- This knob adjusts the level at which the input signals are sent to the master outputs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>S</strong>- Solo button for isolating the channel’s signals. When engaged, all channels that are not also soloed will be removed from the master outputs.</p><p><strong>M</strong>- Mute button for removing a channel’s signals from the master outputs.</p><p><strong>Level Meter</strong>- Visually shows the level at which the input signals are being sent to the master outputs.</p><h3><strong>Master</strong></h3><p><strong>Volume</strong>- This knob controls the volume of the master outputs.</p><p><strong>L and R output jacks</strong>- These are the mixer''s stereo audio or dual CV output jacks.</p><p><strong>M</strong>- Mute button for muting the master outputs.</p>'
