    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Noise Generator simultaneously outputs white and pink noise which can be attenuated by its built-in amplifier.</p><p>Noise signals are random-voltage signals that can be used as audio or control signals. As an audio signal, noise is often used to emulate the percussive hit of a drum or the breathiness of a voice. As a control signal, it can be a great source for creating randomness in a patch. Noise signals are often used as the input signal of a Sample and Hold module which can adjust the rate at which random voltages are output.</p><h2>Outputs and Controls</h2><p><strong>Amount</strong>- Attenuates the amplitude of the noise signals.</p><p><strong>White Noise</strong>- Outputs a random signal in which all frequencies across the frequency spectrum are represented equally.</p><p><strong>Pink Noise</strong>- Outputs a random signal in which each octave across the frequency spectrum is represented equally. Pink noise will sound duller to the ear than white noise, and as a control signal, will be less likely to output higher frequencies.</p>'
