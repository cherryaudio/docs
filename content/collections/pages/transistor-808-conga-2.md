The <em>L</em> (Low), <em>M</em> (Mid), and&nbsp;<em>H</em> (High) buttons select between three preset pitches. When the furthest left button is selected, the pitch of the conga can be adjusted using the <em>Tune</em> knob.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accent Level</strong>- Sets the volume of the accented conga from 100%, meaning it will be the same volume as an unaccented trigger, to 400% meaning it will be four times louder than unaccented triggers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Decay</strong>- Sets the length of the conga sound.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Click Level</strong>- Independent volume control for the initial transient, or "click," at the beginning of the conga sound.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Out jack</strong>- Outputs the conga sound.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>'
