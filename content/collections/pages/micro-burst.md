    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Micro Burst module generates a “burst” of up to 32 CV triggers for each individual trigger it receives. Both the number of triggers per burst and burst rate are CV controllable.</p><p>This module can be used to replicate a number of acoustic sounds such as snare flams, hi-hat rolls and guitar strumming but is just as comfortable creating a cacophony of bleeps and bloops from another world! Try running a clock signal or LFO through the Micro Burst and use its output as the external trigger source for a Sample and Hold module. Modulating a resonant filter’s cutoff or an oscillator’s frequency can create some pretty crazy results!</p><h2><strong>Inputs, Outputs and Controls</strong></h2><p><strong>Trigger jack</strong>- A 5V pulse or gate received at this jack will trigger a “burst” of triggers.<br></p><p><strong>Num of Bursts</strong>- Sets the number of triggers, from 1 to 32, that will be output in each burst. The number can be externally controlled via its <em>Mod</em> CV input jack and attenuator.<br></p><p><strong>Rate</strong>- Adjusts the speed at which the burst triggers are output. The time between triggers in the burst can be adjusted from 10ms to 100ms and can be externally controlled via its <em>Mod</em> CV input jack and attenuator.<br></p><p><strong>Output jack</strong>- A burst of 5V pulses are output from this jack each time a single pulse is received at the <em>Trigger</em> input.<br></p>'
