    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Chorus module is a great sounding and flexible stereo chorus effect featuring CV control of delay time, feedback level, and wet/dry mix. Chorus is created by mixing an audio signal with one or more slightly delayed and pitch-modulated “copies” of itself and is often used to make a sound seem bigger, richer, and wider.</p><h2><strong>Inputs, Outputs and Controls</strong></h2><p><strong>L(M) and R Input jacks</strong>- These are the mono or stereo audio input jacks. When using a mono input signal, patching it to the L(Mono) jack will feed the signal to both sides of the stereo effect.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>- Sets the speed of the pitch modulation from 0.01Hz to 8.0Hz.</p><p><strong>Depth</strong>- Adjusts the depth of the pitch modulation.</p><p><strong>Delay Time</strong>- Sets the amount of time, from 4ms to 50ms, that the “copies” are delayed.</p><p><strong>Delay Time CV Amt jack and attenuator</strong>- CV input for externally controlling the delay time.</p><p><strong>Feedback</strong>- Increases the number of “copies,” or layers, of the input signal by “feeding” the effected signal “back” to the effect input. This is the same principle as a delay pedal with repeating echoes only with shorter delay times.</p><p><strong>Feedback CV Amt jack and attenuator</strong>- CV input for externally controlling the feedback amount.</p><p><strong>Mix (Dry/Wet)</strong>- This knob adjusts the mix between the input signal (Dry) and the effected signal (Wet) that will be sent to the outputs.</p><p><strong>Mix CV Amt jack and attenuator</strong>- CV input for externally controlling the dry/wet mix.</p><p><strong>L and R Output jacks</strong>- These are the module''s stereo output jacks.</p>'
