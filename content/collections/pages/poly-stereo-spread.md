    text: '<p>The Poly Stereo Spread module converts Voltage Modular’s "poly" audio signals to a standard left/right stereo output with CV control of width and balance.&nbsp;</p><p>When using poly modules, it’s necessary to convert the poly signals to standard "mono" signals before sending them to the Main Outs. This module takes care of the conversion while also allowing all of the active voices to be evenly spread between the left and right outputs to create width.</p><p>For example, if the <em>Number of Voices</em> in the Poly CV Outs section of the I/O Panel is set to three and the <em>Width</em> control is set to 100%, one voice will be panned hard left, one will be centered, and one will be panned hard right. The number of active voices will always be spread equally between the two outputs and the overall width can be narrowed by decreasing the <em>Width</em> setting.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep in mind that if all of the active voices are not being played, the panning positions may seem random or unbalanced because there will be "gaps" between voices. If you are playing four note chords with four active voices on the other hand, each chord will remain evenly balanced between the two outputs.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</strong></h2><p><strong>Poly In jack</strong>- Patch “poly” audio signals here.</p><p><strong>Width CV jack and attenuator</strong>- This is a standard "mono" CV jack and attenuator for externally controlling the width of the stereo output.</p><p><strong>Width</strong>- Adjusts the overall width of the stereo output. When set to 100%, the voices will be spread across the entire stereo field from 100% left to 100% right. This range can be narrowed by turning this knob down.</p><p><strong>Bal (Balance) CV jack and attenuator</strong>- This is a standard "mono" CV jack and attenuator for externally controlling the balance of the stereo output.</p><p><strong>Balance</strong>- Adjusts the overall pan position of the voices as a group. In other words it offsets the "center position" which the voices are spread evenly around.</p><p><strong>Out Level</strong>- Handy little volume knob for controlling the level of the stereo output. When converting poly signals back to standard "mono" signals, the summed amplitude of all the voices can become quite loud and often needs to be attenuated.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>L and R Outputs</strong>- Outputs a stereo mix (using standard "mono" cables) of all the voices received at the <em>Poly In</em> jack.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p>'
