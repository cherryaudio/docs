    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Voltage-Controlled Mixer is a four-channel mixer for audio and control signals featuring solos and mutes, individual stereo outs, and CV control of level and pan on each channel. This module essentially consists of four <a href="https://docs.cherryaudio.com/cherry-audio/modules/panner" target="_blank">Panner</a> modules, each with a dedicated VCA (voltage-controlled amplifier), that can be used individually and/or mixed to the master output (which by the way also has a dedicated VCA!).</p><h2><strong>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</strong></h2><h3><strong>Channels 1 - 4</strong></h3><p>Each of the four individual channels feature all of the same jacks and controls, so we will just look at channel 1.<br></p>'

    text: '<p><strong>Input jack</strong>- Audio or CV input jack.</p><p><strong>Pan</strong>- Typical pan control for routing the signal between the left and right outputs of both the channel and master outs.</p><p><strong>Pan CV</strong>- CV input and attenuator for externally controlling the pan position. The <em>-CV</em> and <em>+CV</em> LEDs will light up to indicate the polarity of the voltage currently controlling the pan position.</p><p><strong>S</strong>- Solo button for isolating the channel’s signal. When engaged, all channels that are not also soloed will be muted.</p><p><strong>M</strong>- Mute button for muting the channel.</p><p><strong>VU Meter</strong>- Visually shows the level at which the input signal is being sent to the channel and master outputs.</p><p><strong>Level</strong>- This fader adjusts the channel’s output level (to both the channel and master outputs) from -infinity to +6.0dB.</p><p><strong>Level CV jack and attenuator</strong>- CV input and attenuator for externally controlling the channel’s output level.</p><p><strong>L and R Ch Out jacks</strong>- Individual stereo outputs for the channel.</p><h3><strong>Master Output</strong></h3>'
