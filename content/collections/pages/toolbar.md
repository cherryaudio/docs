    text: '<ul><li><em>Collection</em>- This is the top level of organization, and contains entire “sets” of presets. The <em>Core</em>&nbsp;presets are the main collection of factory presets included with Voltage. New preset collections are included with additionally purchased module sets (such as <em>Misfit Audio Electro Drums</em>), and we also include a <em>User Presets Collection</em>. However, you’re free to create your own collections. To create a new collections, click in the <em>Collection</em>&nbsp;text field (where it says <em>User Presets</em>&nbsp;above) and type a name. User-created sounds can be freely saved to any collection; we like to keep ‘em separated for organizational purposes.</li><li><em>Categories</em>- Within each <em>Collection</em> are a number of sound categories. As with collections, you’re free to create as many categories as you like. To create a category, click in the <em>Category</em> text field of the <em>Save</em> dialog window (where it says <em>MS Patches</em> above) and type a new category name.</li><li><em>Patch</em>- A patch is an individual sound. To save a patch, simply type the name in the <em>Name</em> field and click <em>Save</em>.</li><li><em>Keywords</em>- You can add descriptive words such as “huge,” “noisey,” “poly,” etc. to patches to make them appear when terms are typed in the <em>Search</em> field. Use commas to separate multiple keywords entries.</li><li><em>Type: Effect/Instrument</em>- Select one when saving patches. This tells Voltage Modular whether the patch is intended for use as a virtual instrument, or as an insert effect.</li></ul><p><em>Browsing Patches</em>- Patches can be browsed by clicking the &lt;<em>Select Preset</em>&gt; field. To select a preset collection, click in the area that says &lt;<em>All Collections</em>&gt; or on the downward-facing arrow next to it.</p>'
