    text: '<p>The Trigger to Gate Converter module converts short momentary trigger signals to longer gate signals. The gate length can be set between 5 and 5000 milliseconds and is CV controllable.</p><p>This could be used, for example, to trigger an Envelope Generator (which only has a gate input) with the trig outs of a sequencer such as the Euclidean Duel or to convert the trig out signal from an Eight-Step Sequencer to a CV-controllable variable-length gate signal.</p><h2><strong>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</strong></h2><p><strong>Trigger In jack</strong>- Patch trigger signals here to create longer gate signals. The small red LED flashes when a trigger is received.</p><p><strong>Gate Length</strong>- Adjusts the length (from 5 to 5000 ms) of the gate signals created from each trigger.</p><p><strong>Length CV jack and attenuator</strong>- CV input and bipolar attenuator for externally controlling the <em>Gate Length</em>.</p><p><strong>Gate Out jack</strong>- Outputs a 5V gate signal for each trigger received at the <em>Trigger In</em> jack. The small red LED glows when voltage is being output.</p>'
