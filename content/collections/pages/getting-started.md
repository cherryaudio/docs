    text: '<h3>USER ACCOUNT/LOGGING IN</h3><p>To use Voltage Modular, you’ll need a user account. If you haven’t yet created one, click the *Create Account* button which automatically opens the Cherry Audio website where you’ll be walked through the easy-peasy process. Once a user account is set up, simply enter your email and password in the appropriate fields to start using Voltage Modular.</p><h3>Voltage Modular Install and Copyright Protection</h3><p>Voltage Modular’s copyright protection uses an advanced encryption scheme that customizes the primary app and modules for use on *your* computer only. You''ll need an active internet connection during initial installation of the primary app, modules, and sound presets, but once installed, you''re free to go off the grid, eat organic spelt in a field, and power your music computer with a generator hooked to your stationary recumbent bike. (Voltage Modular is licensed for up to four computers. Users can log into their accounts to control which computers are licensed.)&nbsp;</p><h3>Configuring Standalone Version MIDI and Audio I/O</h3><p>Voltage can be used as a standalone application with or without a hardware keyboard or pad control. With its multiple note and trigger sequencers, you can make a heck of a lot of music without even plugging in a keyboard. To use a hardware keyboard or pad controller, click the gear icon to open *Settings*:</p>'

    text: '<p>Audio inputs and outputs can also be set in this tab. Voltage will typically default to built-in system audio outputs, but clicking the pop-up window will display any other available audio hardware. The audio input can also be set here, but it’s not necessary unless you intend to use Voltage’s audio in jacks to process external audio (more on this in the *I/O Panel* section).</p><h3>GETTING UP AND RUNNING</h3><p>If you’re brand new (or semi-new) to modular synthesis and just want to start making sounds, have a look at the following video. If gives a quick overview of loading presets, adding, moving, and patching modules, and more.</p>'
