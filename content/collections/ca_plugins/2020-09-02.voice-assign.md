                text: '- This the standard polyphonic mode. If the number of notes played exceeds the current maximum setting, it uses a sophisticated allocation scheme to steal the most recently played notes. In use, this means if you''re holding a bass note with your left hand, it won''t disappear while playing chords and melodies with your right hand. Suffice to say, running out of polyphonic voices with DCO-106 is far less of concern than with a real Juno synth as DCO-106''s polyphony can be set up to 16-voices (compared to a Juno''s six voices).'
