        text: 'The VCF section is a 24 db/oct lowpass filter that removes high frequencies as its cutoff frequency setting is decreased from max, resulting in a dulling of sound. DCO-106 features a super-accurate emulation, with particular attention paid to the original Juno''s non-linear self-resonating characteristics - phew, that''s a mouthful, but all you gotta know is that DCO-106 sounds just like the real thing!

        text: '- Sets the frequency where high-frequency attenuation begins, from 20 Hz up to 24,000 Hz. Though it seems odd to have a cutoff control that goes 4000 Hz above human hearing threshold, remember that all filters have a "slope" to their response, so that extra range guarantees you won''t hear any filtering at maximum setting.'

        text: '- Short for “resonance,” this emphasizes sound energy at and around the current cutoff frequency by adding feedback from the filter''s output back to its input. At lower settings, this can be used to create mild resonances such as those heard in acoustic instruments. DCO-106’s implementation is fully self-oscillating - at extreme settings, it can be used as a sine wave generator, but be careful because high resonance settings can result in loud, screamy, dog-terrifying (and speaker blowing) occurrences.'
