        text: 'The original Juno-106 has an often overlooked feature that allows it to send its patches and control position data via MIDI SysEx. We''ve designed DCO-106 to take advantage of this in two ways - its controls can be used as a "hardware surface controller" for DCO-106, and Juno-106 programs can be instantly copied to DCO-106 by simply selecting them. This makes creating and transferring sounds for DCO-106 really fast and easy. '
