        text: 'The original Polymoog had no user-configurable mod routing to speak of - all of its mod routings were fixed. It compensated for this shortcoming by including four LFO''s, but still was fairly limited on the modulation front. Polymode improves upon modulation flexibility in two ways - we added two additional dedicated LFOs (for Rank 2 pulse-width modulation, and global mod of all three of the Resonators'' cutoff frequencies), and significantly, we''ve added user-configurable mod assignments to almost every one of Polymode''s variable synthesis parameters.  Best of all, Polymode''s mod assignments are super easy to use. Here''s how they work:'

For example, if the cutoff slider is currently set to fully open position, adding positive modulation will have no effect. In other words, modulation CV''s can only alter a control setting within its inherent minimum and maximum settings. '
