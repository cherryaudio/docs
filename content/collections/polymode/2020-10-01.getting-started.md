        text: 'The Polymode virtual instrument is inspired by the infamous 70s-era Polymoog synthesizer. One of the world''s first polyphonic synthesizers, its unique multiple filter implementation and mod routings gives it a sound like no other synth - it excels at large pads, strings, and vocal-esque sounds.'

        text: 'Unfortunately, original Polymoogs are known to be highly unreliable as a result of their elaborate circuitry and the inconsistent quality control of 70s electronic components. They were also really expensive ($5200 in mid-70s dollars!), weighed a ton, sensitive to movement, and relatively confusing to operate. Cherry Audio Polymode sidesteps every one of these drawbacks - hooray for modern computers! Of course we''ve eliminated all of the Polymoog''s reliability issues, we''ve updated its controls to make it far easier to use, and we''ve added extensive modulation routing to almost every control for an immense improvement in creative possibilities.
