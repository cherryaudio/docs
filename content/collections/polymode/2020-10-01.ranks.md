        text: 'In Polymoog parlance, each of the two polyphonic oscillator banks is referred to as a "rank," which is good ol'' medieval organ terminology (as are commonly used octave footage numbers). We made the decision to greatly alter the layout of the oscillator rank section because the original Polymoog rank controls are really confusing, and offer no improvement in functionality over the more standard layout we''ve implemented in Polymode. Additionally, the original Polymoog allowed rank 1 to produce '
