        text: 'On the original Polymoog these buttons allowed selection of hard-wired sound presets; in addition to changing waveform, octave, and envelope parameters, the numbered preset buttons also routed audio through fixed filter circuits. Each preset had its own custom fixed filter board, known as a "mode filter." (We weren''t kidding when we said Polymoogs have a lot of filtering options.) '

        text: 'There were actually two original Polymoog models - the 203A, which is the full-tilt boogie version with numerous controls, and eight sound presets/mode filters. A couple of years later, a less expensive, cut-down version (model 280a) was released., but it increased the number of presets (and mode filters) to 14. Generally speaking, the 280A is less desirable, but it featured the desirable "Vox Humana" preset. As a result, many Polymoog 203A owners have their instruments modified to eliminate one of the lesser presets and replace it with the Vox Humana settings and mode filter PCB. We''ve essentially done this in the Polymode module - it retains all eight of the standard Polymoog mode filter presets and adds Vox Humana as a ninth "extra" preset.'
