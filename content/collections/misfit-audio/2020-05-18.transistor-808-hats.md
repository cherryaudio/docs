        text: "If you've ever tried to create a cymbal sound on an analog synthesizer, you might have used some sort of filtered white noise and quickly concluded that this doesn't work well. Though cymbals don't generally have an identifiable underlying root pitch, they're a unique amalgam of pure noise and somewhat random pitched content, generally described as a \"metallic\" tone. This randomly pitched metallic characteristic is why white noise fails miserably when attempting to synthesize realistic sounding cymbals.\_"

        text: 'We don''t know how they arrived at this, but the key to synthesizing Roland-style cymbals lies in using four or six pure square waves, tuned to random intervals (the frequency span is generally from around 200-800 Hz, though it''s not that critical). On its own, this creates a fat, huge atonal mess, but patch this "noise hash" through a steep highpass filter, and you''re left with a surprisingly realistic cymbal tone. (Incidentally, the TR-808 used a "hex inverter" logic chip that''s simple to mildly "misuse" in order to create six simple square-wave oscillators.)'

        text: "The above description above is a simplified a bit - an actual TR-808 then splits the cymbal oscillator \"hash\" in order to replicate the higher pitched initial segment of the sound and the lower pitched \"body\" of the sound. These use separate amplitude envelopes and are filtered a little differently, then mixed together. This is accurately replicated in the Transistor 808 Hats module. The TR-808 cymbal sound (i.e. not the high-hats) uses the same six-square wave oscillator source with its own associated filtering and enveloping.\_"
