        text: 'The Drum Trigger Sequencer is a 16-step trigger/gate sequencer with eight independent channels. It can store up to 32 patterns in a bank, and also includes a song mode for chaining patterns into complete songs - essentially a complete standalone drum machine, minus the sounds. It also includes some very useful features such as per-row step accents, adjustable swing, and pattern/song loading and saving. And though it bears a resemblance to a familiar vintage drum machine, it’s far easier to use.'

When Voltage is used as a virtual instrument in DAW software, the sync signal is constantly output from the IO Panel Sync jack - it does not start and stop with DAW play and stop commands, and it doesn’t know where the beginnings and ends of bars and notes are. You could route this directly to the Drum Trigger Sequencer’s sync in, but it would cause it to run at super-fast 1/96th-note divisions of the master tempo. By design, sync signals are intended to be subdivided down to musically useful clock signals.'

Set up a snare or clap on a channel and route its dry output to mixer as normal. Mult its audio output to a separate VCA, and route the VCA’s audio out to an effect such as a Digital Reverb or a radical feedback-heavy delay. Route the effect’s outputs to the master out (or mixer inputs). Route a separate trigger row CV out to the VCA CV inputs to “open up” the effect signal for emphasis on particular beats.'

Going one step further, a clocked Eight To One module with multiple DC module outs routed to each of its inputs can be used to create a rudimentary pitch sequencer. (Check out the "'
