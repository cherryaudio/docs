        text: "The Euclidean Duel is a dual trigger sequencer with up to 16 steps that generates rhythmic patterns by evenly distributing a selectable number of triggers around the arc of a circle. The concept of Euclidean rhythms was first written about in Godfried Toussaint's 2005 paper titled \"The Euclidean Algorithm Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms.\" Luckily for us, we don't need to worry about the details of the algorithm to know that he's right! Turn some knobs and listen for yourself. This module is fantastic at creating interesting rhythmic patterns, especially when both sequencers are used \"against\" each other to trigger percussive sounds.\_The Euclidean Duel also features extensive CV mod inputs that can be used to alter the traditional rhythms for real-time pseudo-random music creation."
