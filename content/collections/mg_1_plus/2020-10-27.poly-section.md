        text: 'The original MG-1 included a rudimentary poly section that operated independently of the Tone Sources. The good news is that it allowed chords to be played on an otherwise mono (one-note-at-a-time) synth. The bad news is that it was extremely limited - its only control was a single level slider in the mixer section. It could only produce a square wave, its octave range was fixed, and its pitch could not be modulated. As you might guess, this made for a pretty blah poly synth experience. '

        text: 'With that in mind, we expanded the Poly section''s capabilities considerably with a few additions. We added a saw wave, a three-position range selector, and a modulation amount slider in the Modulation section. This may not seem like a much, but trust us, these simple additions make a huge difference in the Poly section''s usability. '
