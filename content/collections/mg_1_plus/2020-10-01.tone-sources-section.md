        text: 'As monophonic analog synths go, MG-1 Plus is unique in that if features two standard mono analog oscillators (i.e., capable of sounding one-note-at-a-time), as well as a "poly" section that can sound up to 32 notes simultaneously. In this section, we''ll discuss the mono oscillators. Note that the MG-1 front panel refers to oscillators as "tone sources;" perhaps Radio Shack felt this would be less intimidating for consumers than, "oscillator."'
