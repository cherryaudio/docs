        text: 'The Filter section is a 24 db/oct lowpass filter that removes high frequencies as its cutoff frequency setting is decreased from max, resulting in a dulling of sound. This a version of the classic transistor "ladder" filter, famously heard in the Moog Minimoog synthesizer, and renowned for its meaty, fat sound. '

Though it seems odd to have a cutoff control that goes 4000 Hz above human hearing threshold, remember that all filters have a "slope" to their response, so that extra range guarantees you won''t hear any filtering at maximum setting.'

        text: '- The "emph" is short of for emphasis, commonly referred to as resonance. This emphasizes sound energy at and around the current cutoff frequency by adding feedback from the filter''s output back to its input. At lower settings, this can be used to create mild resonances such as those heard in acoustic instruments. MG-1 Plusâ€™ implementation is fully self-oscillating - at extreme settings, it can be used as a sine wave generator, but be careful because high resonance settings can result in loud, screamy, dog-terrifying (and speaker blowing) occurrences.'
