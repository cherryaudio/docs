When used with various MIDI-compatible modules, this allows for polyphonic patches, arpeggios and more. Voltage MIDI cables are a little fatter than "standard" patch cables and can only be routed to modules with MIDI jacks, including the Poly Oscillator, Arpeggiator, Poly CV Converter, and a number of MIDI utility modules. The LED beside the jack indicates when MIDI data is being received from a controller.'
