        text: 'One thing to be aware with normalized connections is that input jacks behave a little differently than outputs. If an output jack is normalized to a connection, and a cable is plugged into that output, the normalized connection is not affected; it simply treats any extra cables as if it were a multed output. Conversely, if a cable is plugged into a normalized input, the "invisible" normalled connection is broken and removed from the signal path. '
