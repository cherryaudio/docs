        text: 'A "cabinet" refers to a horizontal row of modules. Cabinets have no width limitations; you’re free to add as many modules as you like. If the number of viewable modules exceeds the width of the Voltage Modular window, a scroll bar appears at the bottom of the window. Optimally, you’ll want to see as much of a patch on-screen as possible, so it makes sense to organize modules into two more cabinets, stacked vertically. (It also makes sense to "borrow" your rich brother''s 120" flat-panel TV and use that as a computer display, but you didn''t hear that from us.)'
