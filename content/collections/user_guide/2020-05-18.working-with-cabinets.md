        text: 'A "cabinet" refers to a horizontal row of modules. Cabinets have no width limitations; you’re free to add as many modules as you like. If the number of viewable modules exceeds the width of the Voltage Modular window, a scroll bar appears at the bottom of the window. Optimally, you’ll want to see as much of a patch on-screen as possible, so it makes sense to organize modules into additional cabinets, stacked vertically. (It also makes sense to "borrow" your rich brother''s 120" flat-panel TV and use that as a computer display, but you didn''t hear that from us.)'

        text: 'Cabinets can be vertically relocated. You can swap positions of multiple cabinets, or move cabinets above or below the I/O Panel or Performance Controls panel. To move a cabinet, click and drag on the left edge of the cabinet frame. It can be little hard to tell where you’re supposed to grab, so we’ve highlighted the "grab" area in red In the screenshot below. It isn’t actually red in Voltage Modular, but it the left and right edges of the currently selected cabinet re shaded a little darker. This works exactly the same for moving the I/O Panel and Performance Controls pane.'
