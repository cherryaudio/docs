        text: 'A basic polyphonic patch typically needs an oscillator, envelope and amplifier for each voice. To create eight-voice polyphony, that’s already 24 modules! Once additional envelopes, filters, modulations etc. are added, it’s easy for a patch to become a huge mess! Poly modules make it easy!'

When set to eight, for example, every poly module is actually a stack of eight standard modules, and every poly jack can send or receive eight individual channels, or "lanes" of CV or audio. This means that only three poly modules are needed to create a patch that would take 24 "mono" modules!'
