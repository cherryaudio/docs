Single-clicking on any Voltage Modular input or output jack reveals a six-way multiple jack (aka, a \"mult\"), which is super convenient for routing (or mixing) multiple sources. The mult will stay visible until a cable is routed, at which point it disappears. If you need more than six jacks for any connection, you can always use a dedicated Multiple module (or link together as many Multiple modules as you like), but using the built-in six-way mults will save a whole lot of patching hassle."

          This one’s not so obvious, but it’s really handy. To patch cables from a single jack to multiple destinations, press and
          hold the [SHIFT] key, click the source jack, then click up to six
          destination jacks as desired and release the [SHIFT] key when you’re
          done. This works with input or output jacks, and is particularly useful
          for patching pitch and gate CV’s from the I/O panel to multiple
          oscillators or envelope generators.

This lets Voltage Modular transmit and receive polyphonic note and controller data, and in conjunction with the Poly Oscillator and other poly-oriented modules, greatly simplifies creating polyphonic patches.'

Virtual MIDI jacks also contain the previously discussed built-in six-way mult, and if that’s not enough, there’s a MIDI Multiple module as well. There are also MIDI input, output, drum trigger modules and more for transmitting and receiving MIDI data with external instruments and other useful functions.'
