                  Deletes all modules. This is here in case a module becomes corrupt; you
                  won't permanently lose anything, because Voltage Modular will "know"
                  your modules have been deleted and automatically re-download all
                  purchased modules. That said, it might take a bit, so don't delete
                  module files five minutes before you're gonna hit the stage.
