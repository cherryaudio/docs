                  Deletes all modules. This is here in case a module becomes corrupt; you
                  won't permanently lose anything, because Voltage Modular will "know"
                  your modules have been deleted and automatically re-download all
                  purchased modules. That said, it might take a bit, so don't delete
                  module files five minutes before you're gonna hit the stage.

                  wiley OS X will automatically adjust for this, so you shouldn’t need to
                  change this.

                  up buying modules. Don’t leave this on if you have an irresponsible kid
                  who’s crazy for modular synthesis (or if YOU are an irresponsible kid
                  who’s crazy for modular synthesis).

These are especially useful if you’re using Voltage Modular’s external inputs to process sound. The '
