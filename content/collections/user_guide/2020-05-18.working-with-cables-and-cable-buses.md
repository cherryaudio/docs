In addition to adding tremendous flexibility, cable buses go a long way toward cleaning up the appearance of patches, due to their invisible nature. Cable buses can be created for mono CV jacks, poly jacks, or MIDI jacks. '

        text: 'This one’s not so obvious, but it’s really handy. To patch cables from a single jack to multiple destinations, press and hold the [CTRL] key in Windows or the [⌘] key on Mac , click the source jack, then click as many destination jacks as desired and release the modifier key when you’re done. This works with input or output jacks, and is particularly useful for patching pitch and gate CV’s from the I/O panel to multiple oscillators or envelope generators. '

        text: 'Voltage Modular’s virtual MIDI cables behave much like standard cables, but instead of carrying a single audio or control voltage signal, they carry 16 channels of note and control data just like a good ol'' MIDI cable.  Though virtual MIDI cables have been somewhat superceded by our Poly jacks, they''re handy for certain applications, particularly when MIDI controller data is being transmitted or received from hardware instruments.

        text: 'You’ll notice that virtual MIDI cables are a bit fatter than standard cables; this is done to make them easy to recognize on-screen (and to fit all that extra data). Virtual MIDI jacks also contain the previously discussed built-in unlimited mult, and if that’s not enough, there’s a MIDI Multiple module as well. If you''re using Voltage Modular Core edition, you''ll find numerous MIDI input, output, drum trigger modules and more for transmitting and receiving MIDI data with external instruments and other useful functions.'
