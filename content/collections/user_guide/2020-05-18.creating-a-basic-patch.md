The green cable routes the keyboard pitch control voltage out (we’ll refer to control voltages as "CV''s" from here on out) to the oscillator’s keyboard CV in to allow keyboard control of pitch. The red cable routes the oscillator’s sawtooth wave output to the main audio outputs. You’ll notice the sound plays continuously, but we''re about to fix that.'
