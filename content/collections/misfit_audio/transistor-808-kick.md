    text: '<p>The Misfit Audio Transistor 808 Kick module is a synthesized recreation of the legendary 808 kick sound with a tunable sine oscillator, filterable transient, internal pitch envelope, and variable click/tone mix control.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</strong></h2><p><strong>Trigger In jack</strong>- A 5V trigger received at this jack will trigger the kick at its "normal," unaccented level. The LED lights when the jack is triggered.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accent In jack</strong>- A 5V trigger received at this jack triggers the kick at its accented level set by the <em>Accent Level</em> knob. The LED lights when the jack is triggered.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tuning</strong>- Adjusts the base pitch of the internal oscillator responsible for the tone of the kick.</p><p><strong>Accent Level</strong>- Sets the volume of the accented kick from 100%, meaning it will be the same volume as an unaccented trigger, to 400% meaning it will be four times louder than unaccented triggers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bend Depth</strong>- Adjusts the amount of pitch modulation imparted on the kick’s tone oscillator. When at zero, the internal pitch envelope will not effect the pitch of the kick drum. Turning this knob up raises the frequency at which the oscillator starts before falling to the pitch set by the <em>Tuning</em> knob.</p><p><strong>Decay</strong>- Sets the length of the kick sound.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bend Rate</strong>- Sets the decay time for the kick drum’s internal pitch envelope. In other words, it adjusts how long it takes the tone oscillator to fall from its starting frequency (set by the <em>Bend Depth)</em>, to the pitch set by the <em>Tuning</em> knob. Short values help give the kick a punchier transient while long values can create a classic 808&nbsp; "bass drop."</p><p><strong>Clk/Tone Mix</strong>- Adjusts the mix between the transient (click) and body (tone) of the kick sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Out jack</strong>- Audio output for the 808 kick.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Click Bright</strong>- Adjusts the brightness of the kick’s transient (click).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>'
