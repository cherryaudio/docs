    text: '<p>The Misfit Audio Digi Sample module is a straightforward, super easy-to-use sample playback module. It''s intended for drum samples or other "one-shot" sample applications.&nbsp; It can load and play samples in AIF, WAV, MP3, and OGG formats.</p><h2>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</h2><p><strong>Trigger In jack</strong>- A 5V trigger received at this jack triggers the sample at its "normal," unaccented level. The LED lights when the jack is triggered.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accent In jack</strong>- A 5V trigger received at this jack triggers the sample at its accented level set by the <em>Accent Level</em> knob. The LED lights when the jack is triggered.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accent Level</strong>- Sets the volume of the accented sample from 100% up to 400%, meaning it will be four times louder than unaccented triggers.</p><p><strong>Tune and</strong><strong>&nbsp;mod CV input and attenuator</strong>- Adjusts the pitch of the current sample up or down three octaves. Samples will get longer as they are tuned down and shorter as they are tuned upward.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Decay&nbsp;</strong><strong>and</strong><strong>&nbsp;mod CV input and attenuator</strong>- Adjusts the decay length of the current sample. The maximum setting will be the entire length of the current sample, i.e. decay cannot be longer than the sample''s inherent length. You can however, extend a sample''s playback length by tuning it down, but this will of course affect pitch.</p><p><strong>Output jack</strong>- Audio output.</p>'
