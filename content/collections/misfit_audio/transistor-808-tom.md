The LED lights when the jack is triggered.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accent In jack</strong>- A 5V trigger received at this jack triggers the tom at its accented level set by the <em>Accent Level</em> knob. The LED lights when the jack is triggered.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tune L, M, H</strong>- Selects the pitch of the tom. The <em>L</em> (Low), <em>M</em> (Mid), and&nbsp;<em>H</em> (High) buttons select from three preset pitches. When the furthest left button is selected, the pitch of the tom can be adjusted using the <em>Tune</em> knob.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accent Level</strong>- Sets the volume of the accented tom from 100%, meaning it will be the same volume as an unaccented trigger, to 400% meaning it will be four times louder than unaccented triggers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Decay</strong>- Sets the length of the tom sound.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Click Level</strong>- Independent volume control for the initial transient, or "click," at the beginning of the tom sound.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Out jack</strong>- Outputs the tom sound.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Noise Level</strong>- Adjusts the volume of the noise oscillator.&nbsp;</p>'
