    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Phaser module is a four-stage phaser audio effect featuring voltage-controlled rate and individual on/off switching for each stage. The stages of this module are made from four notch filters instead of typical all-pass filters creating a unique type of phaser effect.</p><h2><strong>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</strong></h2><p><strong>L(M) and R Input jacks</strong>- These are the mono or stereo audio input jacks. When using a mono input signal, patching it to the <em>L(Mono)</em> jack will feed the signal to both sides of the stereo effect. This is a true stereo effect unit with each side having its own phaser effect. The internal LFOs that modulate the frequency of the left and right notch filters are 180Â° out of phase with each other to create a sweeping motion from left to right.</p><p><strong>Stages</strong>- These buttons engage each of the independent notch filters that make up the phaser effect. Each of the four notch filters modulates through a different range of frequencies with stage one being the lowest and stage four the highest.</p><p><strong>Rate Mod jack and attenuator</strong>- CV input jack and attenuator for externally controlling the <em>Rate</em><em>.</em></p><p><strong>Rate</strong>- Adjusts the rate, from .02Hz to 10Hz, at which the notch filters frequencies are modulated by the internal LFO.</p><p><strong>Feedback</strong>- Adjusts how much of the filtered signal is sent back to the input of the effect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>L and R Output jacks</strong>- These are the module''s stereo output jacks.&nbsp;</p>'
