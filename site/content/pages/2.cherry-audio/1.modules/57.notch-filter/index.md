    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Notch Filter is a variable-bandwidth audio filter for removing frequencies in a CV-controllable notch. This module can be used "surgically" to target and remove unwanted frequencies from an audio signal or can be used more creatively to create phaser-type effects by modulating the filter’s frequency.</p><h2><strong>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</strong></h2><p><strong>Input jack</strong>- Patch audio signals here.</p><p><strong>CV Mod jack and attenuator</strong>- CV input jack and attenuator for externally controlling the <em>Frequency.</em></p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>- Sets the frequency where the filter’s notch will be. Audio content at and around this frequency will be removed from the input signal.</p><p><strong>Bypass button</strong>- When lit red, the notch filter is active. When gray, the filter is bypassed. Notch filters are often used to make subtle adjustments. Toggling this button on and off can help identify which frequencies are being removed by the filter.</p><p><strong>Bandwidth</strong>- Adjusts the width of the notch. Low values create a narrow notch while higher values create a wider notch.</p><p><strong>Output jack</strong>- Outputs the filtered audio signal.</p>'
