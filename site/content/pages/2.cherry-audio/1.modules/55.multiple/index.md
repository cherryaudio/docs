    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Multiple is a dual module that “copies” the CV or audio signal received at its input to four output jacks so that the signal can be sent to multiple destinations. When the <em>Link</em> button is engaged, the input from module one is sent to the outputs of module two as well, creating a total of eight copies. Since every jack in Voltage Modular can have up to six cables connected to it, it’s possible to send a mix of six input signals to as many as 48 output jacks when linked!&nbsp;</p><p>The Multiple module can also be used to help organize or quickly re-route signals. Copying the&nbsp;<em>Pitch</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Gate</em>&nbsp;jacks from the I/O panel, for example, is a common practice for keeping things tidy and versatile.&nbsp;By using the outputs of a Multiple to send pitch and gate CVs to all of the oscillators and envelopes in a patch, the input source can easily be changed, to an arpeggiator or sequencer for example, without having to re-patch every pitch and gate CV.</p><h2>Inputs, Outputs and Controls</h2><p><strong>Input jack</strong>- This is the input jack for the CV or audio signal that will be copied to the output jacks. As many as six signals can be patched to this input.</p><p><strong>Output jacks</strong>- These four jacks will output a copy of the signal received at the input jack. Each jack can have up to six cables patched to it for a total of 24 possible copies.</p><p><strong>Link</strong>- When this button is engaged, the input from module one will be copied to the outputs of module two as well, and the input of module two will be ignored. When linked there is a total of 48 possible copies.</p>'
