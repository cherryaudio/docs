    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Eight To One Switch module routes eight audio or control input signals to a single output jack. An input signal is only passed to the output when its respective “step” is active. The inputs can be stepped through sequentially with a manual or CV trigger, or targeted individually via discrete control voltages.</p><p>Switches are used to re-route signals without having to unplug or re-patch any cables. As an example, the Eight To One Switch could be used to send different modulation sources to a single destination or switch between different oscillator waveforms. The fun starts when you begin experimenting with different ways to step through the inputs!</p><h2>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</h2><p><strong>1-8 input jacks and LEDs</strong>- Input jacks for up to eight signals that will be routed to the output jack whenever their respective step is active. The small red LEDs give visual feedback of the active step.</p><p><strong>Steps</strong>- Sets the number of steps that can be activated. When stepping through the inputs sequentially with either the manual or <em>Step Trigger</em>&nbsp;CV input, this sets the number of the last step before it will cycle back to step one.</p><p><strong>Step Trigger jack</strong>- A 5V pulse or gate received at this jack will trigger the steps sequentially.</p><p><strong>Step CV jack</strong>- CV input jack for switching between steps in any order. The control voltage range of 0V - 5V is evenly divided between the number of steps making it possible to target specific steps with discrete voltages.</p><p>Here are a couple examples of how the voltage is divided:</p><ul><li>If <em>Steps</em>&nbsp;is set to two, the 5V range is divided between the two steps. Step one is selected with voltage from 0V - 2.49V and step two is selected with 2.5V - 5V.<br></li><li>If <em>Steps</em>&nbsp;is set to eight, the 5V range will be divided equally between the eight steps. Five divided by eight is 0.625 so, step one = 0V - 0.62V, step two = 0.63V - 1.24V, step three = 1.25V - 1.87V and so on.<br></li></ul><p>If you don’t happen to make music with a calculator next to you, we recommend just playing around until you find the step you’re looking for!</p><p><strong>Reset jack</strong>- A 5V pulse or gate received at this jack will immediately force the module back to step one. Note that resetting the module will be unnoticeable when using the <em>Step CV</em>&nbsp;input because the voltage received at its jack is constantly updating the active step.</p><p><strong>Manual Step</strong>- Click this button to manually advance to the next sequential step.</p><p><strong>Out jack</strong>- Outputs the active step’s input signal.</p>'
