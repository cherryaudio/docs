    text: '<p>The Mini Poly to Mono module mixes, or sums, the individual signals carried by a "poly" CV or audio cable to a standard "mono" output jack. This module can be used, for example, to mix the individual audio signals, or voices, of a poly synth to a standard mono output so that it can be sent to the <em>Main Outs</em>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</h2><p><strong>Poly In jack</strong>- Patch "poly" CV or audio cables here to convert the signals to standard "mono" cables.</p><p><strong>Mix Level</strong>- Adjusts the level of the combined signals. It is often necessary to attenuate the output to compensate for the increase in amplitude caused by summing multiple signals.</p><p><strong>Mix Out jack</strong>- Outputs a standard "mono" signal carrying the sum of all signals received by the <em>Poly In</em> jack.</p>'
