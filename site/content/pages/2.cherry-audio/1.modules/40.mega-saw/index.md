    text: '<p>Mega Saw delivers the immense "hoover" sound of multiple detuned sawtooth waves with up to 32 simultaneous saws plus CV-controllable detune amount. It''s perfect for massive EDM lead lines, dramatic trailers, and more.&nbsp; We''ll go over its functions, section by section.<br></p><h2>Keyboard CV</h2><p><strong>Keyb CV jack</strong>- Accepts a CV input for pitch. Typically this would come from the PITCH jack in the IO Panel CV OUT section, or from a sequencer pitch CV out.</p><h2>Saws</h2><p><strong>Number Of Saws </strong>and number display- This sets the total number of sawtooth waves you''ll hear. The display shows the current number of saws (in case you don''t feel like counting all those little lines around the knob).</p><p><strong>Detune</strong>- Sets the average pitch detune amount for all sawtooth waves - higher values "spread" the detuning between the saws for a larger sound.</p><h2>Detune Mod</h2><p><strong>Detune Mod</strong>&nbsp;attenuator and input jack- CV input for modulating the amount of detuning. Center setting is zero, and negative or positive modulation can be applied by turning the knob left or right.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Keyb CV jack</strong>- Accepts a CV input for pitch. Typically this would come from the IO Panel PITCH jack in the CV OUT section, or from a sequencer pitch CV out.</p><h2>Freq</h2><p><strong>Range</strong>- Sets the basic pitch of the oscillator, displayed in traditional organ footage.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Fine</strong>- Fine-tune control for pitch.&nbsp;</p><h2>Freq Mod</h2><p><strong>Freq Mod</strong>&nbsp;attenuator and input jack- CV input for modulating overall pitch. Center setting is zero, and negative or positive modulation can be applied by turning the knob left or right. Useful for adding vibrato with an LFO, siren noises, envelope-controlled pitch sweeps, etc.</p><h2>Output</h2><p><strong>Output Jack</strong>- Where all those saw waves come out!&nbsp;</p>'
