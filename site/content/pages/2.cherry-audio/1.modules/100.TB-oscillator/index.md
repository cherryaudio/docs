    text: '<p>TB Oscillator is a super-accurate modular recreation of the oscillator section of the simple-but-beefy oscillator of the world''s most iconic acid techno bass synth. Like many vintage oscillators, its waveforms aren''t totally accurate on an oscilloscope, which gives them a unique character. In addition to its standard controls, the TB Oscillator''s W<em>ave Mix</em> control adds new tone colors.</p><h2>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</h2><p><strong>Keyb CV jack</strong>- Accepts a CV input for pitch. Typically this would come from the <em>Pitch</em> jack in the IO Panel <em>CV Out</em>&nbsp;section, or from a sequencer pitch CV out.</p><p><strong>Range</strong>- Sets the basic pitch of the oscillator, displayed in traditional organ footage, i.e. larger number equals lower pitch.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tuning</strong>- Fine tune control for pitch, up or down about a fourth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Freq CV mod input</strong>- Allows modulation of oscillator pitch. Note that the attenuator knob is bipolar, i.e. "zero" position is center. Turning right adds a positive modulation, turning left inverts the incoming CV.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wave Mix and Mix Out jack</strong>- Allows blending of the saw and square waves when using the <em>Mix Out </em>jack.</p><p><strong>Mix CV mod input</strong>- CV control input for the <em>Wave Mix </em>control.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Waveform out jacks</strong>- Output jacks for sawtooth and square waves.&nbsp;</p>'

  description: 'The Vintage Oscillator is a fat and warm sounding oscillator that flawlessly replicates the unique waveform discrepancies and minute drift characteristics of coveted classic analog oscillators. It generates all standard synthesis waveforms and features both exponential and linear frequency-modulation inputs.'
