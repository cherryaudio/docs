    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Distortion module is an aggressive distortion effect unit with voltage control of distortion amount and audio level compensation. This is a great all-purpose distortion unit for adding some bite to a drum loop, attitude to a bass line, harmonics to a sub etc.</p><p>Note that although distortion is typically used as an audio effect, it can also be used to alter the shape or curve of LFOs and envelopes.</p><h2><strong>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</strong></h2><p><strong>Input jack</strong>- Patch audio signals here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CV Mod jack</strong>- CV input for externally controlling the <em>Dist Amount.</em></p><p><strong>Dist (Distortion) CV Amount</strong>- This knob attenuates the CV signal received at the <em>CV Mod</em> jack.</p><p><strong>Dist (Distortion) Amount</strong>- Adjusts the amount of distortion imparted on the input signal. Low values can add subtle harmonics or saturation while high values can become quite aggressive.</p><p><strong>Output Level</strong>- Adjusts the output level of the distorted signal. This is typically used to compensate for the raise in volume caused by adding distortion.</p><p><strong>Output jack</strong>- Outputs the distorted audio signal.</p><p><br></p>'
