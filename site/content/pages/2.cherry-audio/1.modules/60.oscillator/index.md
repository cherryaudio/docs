    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio "standard" oscillator is a full-featured classic analog-synthesis oscillator. It generates all standard synthesis waveforms and can be used as an audio source, or as a control voltage (CV) modulation source. Its waveform outputs are always “on”; you’ll need to use a mixer or amplifier (VCA) of some sort to start and stop its sound.</p><h2>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</h2><p><strong>Keyb CV jack</strong>- Accepts a CV input for pitch. Typically this would come from the PITCH jack in the IO Panel CV OUT section, or from a sequencer pitch CV out.</p><p><strong>Frequency Mod</strong>&nbsp;attenuator and input jack- This is used for externally modulating the oscillator frequency. It''s useful for adding vibrato with an LFO, siren noises, envelope-controlled pitch sweeps, etc.</p><p><strong>Hard Sync</strong>- Force resets the start of the waveform to the beginning of its cycle. Most often used to create the "sync sweep" oscillator sounds made famous in The Cars'' "Let''s Go" (or Kraftwerk''s "Neon Lights" and No Doubt''s "Just A Girl"), by routing the output of a second oscillator to the <em>Hard Sync</em>&nbsp;input and sweeping the pitch of the first oscillator.</p><p>Hard Sync is also useful when creating drum and percussion sounds to ensure that the wave starts at the beginning of its cycle.</p><p><strong>Range</strong>- Sets the basic pitch of the oscillator, displayed in traditional organ footage. <em>LO</em>&nbsp;will be beneath the audible range and allows the oscillator to be used as a mod source.</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>- Fine-tune control for pitch. This can be used to fatten up multi-oscillator patches by detuning a small amount, or for "building-in" a set interval. Its range is a smidge over a fifth, up or down.</p><p><strong>Pulse Width</strong>- This sets the width or "duty-cycle" of the pulse wave. It has no effect on any other waveform. Its default setting of 50% outputs a perfect square wave, rich in delicious odd-order harmonics. Moving the knob left or right narrows its width as well as the thickness of sound until it almost disappears at its extremes, and we’ve included a nifty “faux-OLED” display to indicate the current pulse width.</p><p><strong>PWM Amount attenuator and PWM Mod input jack</strong>- You may have noticed that moving the <em>Pulse Width</em>&nbsp;knob back and forth creates a nifty sound; instead of wearing our your mouse hand, the <em>PWM Mod</em>&nbsp;input can be used in conjunction with an LFO, envelope generator, or other mod source to continuously vary the pulse width. Best of all, the OLED display looks real cool swooping back and forth.</p><p><strong>Waveform Output Jacks</strong>- These are output jacks for ramp, sawtooth, pulse, sine, and triangle waves. These can be used simultaneously, in any combination.</p>'
