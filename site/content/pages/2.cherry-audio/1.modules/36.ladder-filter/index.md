Since this is a low-pass filter, all frequencies lower than this value will be allowed to pass through the filter while frequencies higher than the cutoff will be attenuated at a rate of 24db per/octave.</p><p><strong>Emph (Emphasis) Mod jack and attenuator</strong>- CV input jack and attenuator for externally controlling the emphasis (resonance) of the filter.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Emphasis</strong>- Turning this knob up emphasizes sound energy at and around the cutoff frequency by adding feedback from the filter’s output back to its input. On other filters this is often called Resonance. With higher settings, any modulations or knob twisting of the cutoff frequency becomes more pronounced.</p><p><strong>Sat Mod jack and attenuator</strong>- CV input jack and attenuator for externally controlling the saturation amount.</p><p><strong>Saturation</strong>- Adds distortion to the signal. This is where things begin to get raw and raunchy!</p><p><strong>Output jack</strong>- Outputs the filtered audio signal.</p>'
