    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Sub Octave module is a sub-octave generator that tracks the pitch of an input signal and generates square waves one and two octaves below it. There are individual attenuators for each sub-octave as well as the direct input allowing you to create the perfect mix between the three signals. This module will instantly fatten up an oscillator and is a quick way to add some weight to your sounds!</p><p>Although this module is usually used to create lower octaves of oscillators or audio signals, it is worth noting that it will also work on LFOs and can create some interesting patterns when mixing the two sub-octave square waves with the original.</p><h2>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</h2><p><strong>Input jack</strong>- This is the input jack for the signal whose pitch will be tracked.</p><p><strong>Direct Out jack and attenuator</strong>- Output and level control for the signal received at the Input jack.</p><p><strong>-1 Oct Out jack and attenuator</strong>- Output and level control for the square wave generated one octave below the input signal.<br></p><p><strong>-2 Oct Out jack and attenuator</strong>- Output and level control for the square wave generated two octaves below the input signal.<br></p><p><strong>Mix Out jack</strong>- Outputs a mix of all three attenuated signals.</p>'
