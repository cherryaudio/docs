    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Crossfade module is a CV controllable two channel mixer, usable with both audio and control signals. This module smoothly mixes between two input signals with a single knob and/or the <em>CV Mod</em>&nbsp;input.</p><p>Remember that <strong>any</strong>&nbsp;two signals can be mixed. You could, for instance, mix two LFOs together to create a more complex shape, combine two different CV sequences, or even modulate between a sync signal and an oscillator if you were so inclined! Or maybe you’d rather use it like a DJ crossfader and mix between two drum beats.</p><h2>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</h2><p><strong>Input jacks 1 and 2</strong>- These are the input jacks for the two signals that will be mixed together.</p><p><strong>CV Mod input jack</strong>- CV input for externally modulating the balance between the two input signals.</p><p><strong>CV Mod Amount</strong>- Scales the amplitude of the CV signal received at the <em>CV Mod</em>&nbsp;input jack.</p><p><strong>Initial Balance</strong>- Sets the initial balance of the two input signals before any CV modulation. It can also be used to manually mix between the two signals. Assign this knob to a midi controller’s slider to create a DJ-style crossfader.</p>'
