    text: '<p>The Cherry Audio Spring Reverb module is a realistically modeled spring-style reverb with adjustable decay length and true-stereo operation. Spring reverbs can be used in many situations. Short decaying spring reverbs are great for adding a little energy or life into a sound without drastically changing it, while long decaying spring reverbs can take a sound into an entirely new dimension! And let''s not forget how cool a classic surf guitar riff sounds drenched in spring reverb!</p><h2>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</h2><p><strong>L(M) and R Input jacks</strong>- These are the mono or stereo audio input jacks. When using a mono input signal, patching it to the <em>L(Mono)</em> jack will feed the signal to both sides of the stereo effect.<br></p><p><strong>Input</strong>- This knob adjusts the level at which the input signal is sent to the spring reverb effect.<br></p><p><strong>Decay (Short/Long)</strong>- Adjusts the length of the reverb.<br></p><p><strong>Mix (Dry/Wet)</strong>- This knob adjusts the mix between the input signal (<em>Dry</em>) and the effected signal (<em>Wet</em>) that will be sent to the outputs.<br></p><p><strong>L(M) and R Output jacks</strong>- These are the moduleâ€™s stereo output jacks. When using a mono input signal and wish to keep the reverb mono as well, use the<em> L(Mono) Output</em> jack.</p>'
