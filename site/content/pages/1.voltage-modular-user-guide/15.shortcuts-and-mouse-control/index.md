      <h1>KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS AND MOUSE CONTROL<br></h1><p>Following is a list of Voltage Modular's keyboard shortcuts (or "hot keys," if you prefer). We'll also talk about some not-so-obvious handy mouse functions. <br></p><h3>KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS<br></h3><p>Please note that shortcut key functionality can be affected by "focus" and existing key shortcuts in the the host app when running Voltage Modular as a virtual instrument. <br></p><h4>New Patch - OS X [COMMAND+N], Windows [CTRL+N]<br></h4><p>Creates a blank new patch. If an unsaved patch is currently open, Voltage Modular asks if you'd like to first save the existing patch. <br></p><h4>Save Patch - OS X [COMMAND+S], Windows [CTRL+S]<br></h4><p>Saves the current patch.</p><h4>Previous Preset - OS X [COMMAND+left arrow key], Windows [CTRL+left arrow key]</h4><p>Loads the previous preset in the current bank.<br></p><h4>Next Preset - OS X [COMMAND+right arrow key], Windows [CTRL+right arrow key]</h4><p>Loads the next preset in the current bank.</p><h4>Undo - OS X [COMMAND+Z], Windows [CTRL+Z]<br></h4><p>Cancels the last edit action. Voltage Modular remembers all edits back to the last save, so <em>Undo</em> can be repeatedly clicked if you really make a mess of things! <br></p><h4>Redo - OS X [SHIFT+COMMAND+Z], Windows [SHIFT+CTRL+Z]<br></h4><p>Returns controls to their state prior to the last undo. Voltage Modular remembers all edits back to the last save, so you can also step forward through edits. <br></p><h4>Zoom View In/Out - OS X [COMMAND+PLUS KEY/MINUS KEY], Windows [CTRL+PLUS KEY/MINUS KEY] <br></h4><p>This zooms the view of the IO Panel, Perform controls and module cabinets. Use the + and - keys above the QWERTY keyboard. <br></p><h4>Reset Zoom To 100% - OS X [COMMAND+0], Windows [COMMAND+0]</h4><p>Resets the zoom of the IO Panel, Perform controls and module cabinets to 100%. Use the zero key above the QWERTY keyboard. <br></p><h4>Show/Hide Library Tab - OS X [COMMAND+1], Windows [CTRL+1]<br></h4><p>Toggles the visibility of the <em>Library</em> tab. This is useful for making room for large patches. <br></p><h4>Show/Hide Performance Controls - OS X [COMMAND+2], Windows [CTRL+2]<br></h4><p>Toggles the visibility of the <em>Perform</em> controls tab. This is also useful for making room for large patches. <br></p><h4>Delete Module - [DELETE] key<br></h4><p>In OS X version, use the 
      backspace key in the main keyboard area (above the back slash key); in 
      Windows, use the DEL key (above the arrow keys). Note that a module (or 
      multiple modules) must be selected. </p><h3>MOUSE CONTROL<br></h3><p>Though most of the mouse functions are obvious, there are a couple of mouse-related-things that aren't so obvious, so in no particular order... <br></p><h4>Zooming With Mouse Wheel, Track Pad, or Magic Mouse -<br>OS X desktop Magic Mouse [COMMAND+slide finger]<br>OS X desktop mouse w/wheel [COMMAND+mouse wheel]<br>OS X Macbook/Macbook Pro [COMMAND+two-finger trackpad up/down]<br>Windows desktop mouse w/wheel [CTRL+mouse wheel]<br>Windows laptop mouse [CTRL+trackpad up/down]</h4><p>The view of the IO Panel, Perform controls and module cabinets can be zoomed in or out. The cursor must be within the boundaries of the IO Panel, Perform controls, or a cabinet.</p><h4>Rapidly Routing A Cable To Multiple Destinations <br></h4><p>We discussed this trick back in the <strong><a href="https://docs.cherryaudio.com/voltage-modular-user-guide/working-with-cables-and-jacks">Working With Cables and Jacks</a></strong> section, but we like it so much (and it's real easy to miss), we thought we'd mention it again:</p><p> To patch cables from a single jack to multiple destinations, press and hold the [SHIFT] key, click the source jack, then click up to six destination jacks as desired and release the [SHIFT] key when you’re done. This works with input or output jacks, and is particularly useful for patching pitch and gate CV’s from the I/O panel to multiple oscillators or envelope generators.</p><h4>Mouse Behavior Settings<br></h4><p>We also cover these in the <strong><a href="https://docs.cherryaudio.com/voltage-modular-user-guide/settings">Settings</a></strong> section, but hey, you're already here, amiright?<br></p><ul><li><em>On Control Double-Click</em>- Defines what happens when the mouse is double-clicked on a control. If <em>Edit Value</em>&nbsp;is selected, an exact number can be entered by typing the number and hitting [ENTER] or [RETURN]. If <em>Sets Default Value</em>&nbsp;is selected, double-clicking a control resets it to its default value </li><li><em>Mouse Wheel Adjusts Control Value</em>- Enabling this lets 
      you adjust knob, slider, and switch values by moving the mouse wheel (or
       sliding your finger if you're using an Apple Magic Mouse). <br></li><li><em>Do Not Show Tooltips Unless From Mouse Down</em>-
       With this checked, tooltips won’t display when hovering over controls; 
      they’ll only display if the mouse button is down. This typically occurs 
      when moving a rotary knob or slider control.</li></ul><h4>The Selecting Multiple Buttons Trick<br></h4><p>Click and drag on a toggle button, then drag across adjacent same-function buttons to engage or disengage multiple buttons.<br></p><p>As of this writing, this is only supported in the fabulous Misfit Audio <strong><a href="https://store.cherryaudio.com/modules/drum-trigger-sequencer">Drum Trigger Sequencer</a></strong> module, but you'll likely see this feature in other modules containing rows of similar button controls. <br></p>
