    text: '<h1>WORKING WITH CABINETS</h1><p>A "cabinet" refers to a horizontal row of modules. Cabinets have no width limitations; you’re free to add as many modules as you like. If the number of viewable modules exceeds the width of the Voltage Modular window, a scroll bar appears at the bottom of the window. Optimally, you’ll want to see as much of a patch on-screen as possible, so it makes sense to organize modules into two more cabinets, stacked vertically. (It also makes sense to "borrow" your rich brother''s 120" flat-panel TV and use that as a computer display, but you didn''t hear that from us.)</p><h3>The Cabinets Library Tab</h3><p><em>Loading Cabinets</em>- Cabinets can be added to the current preset by clicking the <em>Add</em>&nbsp;button, dragging to the module area, or by double-clicking. Newly added cabinets always appear beneath existing cabinets, but once a cabinet is added, modules can be freely dragged between cabinets.</p>'

    text: '<p><em>Saving Cabinets</em>- To save a cab, right-click either on the left-edge of a cabinet, in open area of the cab (i.e., an open space without a module), or on one of the “aluminum” rails and select <em>Save Cabinet</em>.</p>'

    text: '<p>Choose an existing category by clicking the downward arrow, or type in the text field to create a custom category, then type a name in the <em>Name</em>&nbsp;field. The <em>Save With Cables</em>&nbsp;box is on by default and will save all cable routings. Disabling it will save the module layout only, without cables.<br></p>'

    text: '<p><em>Deleting Cabinets</em>- To permanently delete a cabinet from the library, right-click it in the library tab and click <em>Delete</em>. Be careful with this (though you can hit the <em>Undo</em>&nbsp;button).</p><p>Like the <em>Modules</em>&nbsp;tab, cabinets can be saved in user-named categories, but unlike modules, which are “pre-assigned” to one of Voltage Modular’s five module categories, there are no limitations on the naming convention or number of cabinet categories.</p><p><em>Search</em>- This super-handy field lets you search for modules by typing a few letters of the module name. For example, typing “LFO” would display the LFO and MiniLFO modules. The search field can be initialized by clicking the <em>X</em>&nbsp;icon.</p>'

Cabinets can also be added by right-clicking anywhere in the empty gray area and clicking <em>Add Cabinet</em>.</p><h3>Cabinet Right-Click Menu</h3><p>The contextual menus that appear when you right-click in a "blank" (i.e., no modules) area of the cabinet.</p>'

    text: '<p><em>Add Module</em>...- Allows modules to be added quickly without using the <em>Library</em> tab. The submenu displays Favorites, then the five module type categories. <br></p><p><em>Add Empty Cabinet</em>- Adds a new blank cabinet. The new cabinet will appear beneath if there are any existing cabinets.</p><p><em>Save Cabinet</em>- Saves the cabinet that’s being right-clicked to the library <em>Cabinet</em>&nbsp;tab.</p><p><em>Duplicate Cabinet</em>- Creates a copy of the cabinet with all modules directly beneath. All cables <em>within the cabinet only</em>&nbsp;remain intact.</p><p><em>Duplicate Cabinet With External Cables</em>- Creates a copy of the cabinet with all modules directly beneath. All cables will be intact, <em>including cables patched to destinations not within the cabinet</em>. (e.g., I/O panel connections).</p><ul><li><strong><em>Helpful Hint</em></strong>- The <em>Duplicate Cabinet</em>&nbsp;commands are particularly useful when creating polyphonic patches using the Poly CV Converter module - patch up a one "voice" of synth, use <em>Duplicate Cabinet</em>&nbsp;to copy the single synth voice multiple times, then patch the appropriate pitch and gate CV''s from the Poly CV Converter.<br></li></ul><p><em>Remove Cabinet</em>- Clears the entire cabinet and its cables. Be careful with this one, as it’s easy to mess up patches (you can always hit the <em>Undo</em>&nbsp;button).</p>'

    text: '<p><em>Align Modules</em>- This is a quick shortcut for "pulling together" modules and eliminating gaps between them. <em>Align Modules&gt;Left</em>&nbsp;pulls all modules in the cabinet to the left. If there are no modules “hidden” beyond the right border of the Voltage Modular window, <em>Align Modules&gt;Right</em>&nbsp;pulls all modules in the cabinet to the right window border. If there are modules beyond the right window border, <em>Align Modules&gt;Right</em>&nbsp;aligns all modules in the cabinet to edge of the right-most module.</p><p><em>Select All Modules</em>- Highlights all modules in the cabinet. You’d typically use this to move or delete all modules in a cabinet simultaneously.</p><h3>Moving Cabinets</h3><p>Cabinets can be vertically relocated. You can swap positions of multiple cabinets, or move cabinets above or below the I/O Panel or Performance Controls panel. To move a cabinet, click and drag on the left edge of the cabinet frame. It can be little hard to tell where you’re supposed to grab, so we’ve highlighted the "grab" area in red In the screenshot below (it isn’t actually red in Voltage Modular). This works exactly the same for moving the I/O Panel and Performance Controls pane.</p>'
