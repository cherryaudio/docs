    text: '<p>The Misfit Audio Digi Sample module is a straightforward, super easy-to-use sample playback module. It''s intended for drum samples or other "one-shot" sample applications.&nbsp; It can load and play samples in AIF, WAV, MP3, and OGG formats.</p><h2>Inputs, Outputs, and Controls</h2><p><strong>Trigger In jack</strong>- A 5V trigger received at this jack triggers the sample at its "normal," unaccented level. The LED lights when the jack is triggered.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accent In jack</strong>- A 5V trigger received at this jack triggers the sample at its accented level set by the <em>Accent Level</em> knob. The LED lights when the jack is triggered.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Load Sample</strong>- Opens a dialog where sample files can be selected and loaded. Loaded samples will save with Voltage Modular patches.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><em>Samples may also be loaded</em> </strong>by clicking on the wave display or dragging and dropping files directly from computer folders onto the Digi Sample module.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accent Level</strong>- Sets the volume of the accented sample from 100% up to 400%, meaning it will be four times louder than unaccented triggers.<br></p><p><strong>Wave Display</strong>- Displays a visual reference of the currently loaded sample. The display automatically scales horizontally to best fit the current sample, regardless of actual sample duration. If the sample is stereo, the waveform will be a composite of both channels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tune and</strong><strong>&nbsp;mod CV input and attenuator</strong>- Adjusts the pitch of the current sample up or down three octaves. Samples will get longer as they are tuned down and shorter as they are tuned upward.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Decay&nbsp;</strong><strong>and</strong><strong>&nbsp;mod CV input and attenuator</strong>- Adjusts the decay length of the current sample. The maximum setting will be the entire length of the current sample, i.e. decay cannot be longer than the sample''s inherent length. You can however, extend a sample''s playback length by tuning it down, but this will of course affect pitch.</p><p><strong>L(M) and R output jacks</strong>- Audio outputs. Mono samples will output on the <em>L(M)</em>&nbsp;jack only.&nbsp;</p>'
